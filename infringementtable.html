I am filling this complaint for the reasons below:

1)	The company removed my name from the manuscript as retaliation because I left the company
2)	The authors have taken my work and claimed this is their work 
3)	They used my name in the acknowledgment section without my consent or giving me any chance to verify the contents of the manuscript
4)	The manuscript contains some parts that are not true

For the details, please see the attached files.

I am a young researcher. Every work of mine is hard-earned, and it is very disappointing to see that these veteran researchers stole my work and claimed that this is their work. I tried to solve this in many ways. They either ignored me or pretended that it was very normal to steal someone’s work. It is their mercy whether I will get anything out of my hard work.

I contacted the corresponding authors and the Beckman representative, Liliana Tejidor. Liliana Tejidor is not a corresponding author, but she is responsible for all decisions for this kind of project as a company representative. The corresponding author is nothing but a hired researcher only. 

I have been trying to resolve the issue since June 30, 2021. I reached out to the author, but they did not want to solve the issue. Then I reached out to the journal. The Journal asked them to solve the issue but showed them how to just include my name nominally without giving me proper credit for my work.

Clients pay initial setup fees plus monthly subscription fees for access to various FFS videos, which FFS typically hosts for its subscribers on a commercial video-hosting platform. FFS protects its videos by providing video hosting, whereby visitors to a subscriber’s website have access only to a stream of the video, rather than a copy. Hosting is configured so that video source download is unavailable.

FFS has recently discovered that the respondent has illegally made and posted copies of FFS property online, including at least the following:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuM6_JEmwuY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko2HFBvCa9s

The creation, distribution and ongoing public availability of these videos violate our copyrights. Respondent has no right to make copies, ignoring the clear copyright statement visible on each video.  Respondent has no license to distribute </td><td>Fast Forward Stories' business has been harmed by respondent's infringement in lost revenue, reduced market and substantially increased risk of additional infringement(s).

Respondent could have availed themselves of the content by licensing directly from FFS — in fact, the CMI information on each video indicate clearly the Internet location where licensing could have been arranged.  By electing to evade protections, copy, upload, display and make the work available for public performance, respondent deprived FFS of the modest fees respondent would have paid to license the content legally.  For the span of time these illegal copies have been publicly available, FFS licensing and hosting fees for respondent would have ranged from $6,534 to $26,344, depending on the set of videos selected.

The public display and ease of free public performance enabled by respondent's illegal posting of the videos on the dominant public video service (YouTube) also harmed FFS by reducing the market for commercial licensing.  Potential licensees have turned down licensing and payment because "they could get the same thing on YouTube", depriving FFS of the opportunity to recoup its substantial inve</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffff">No claim certified, no orders to amend</td><td>Say It Visually, Inc</td><td>none</td><td>America's Real Estate Brokers</td><td>Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/22-CCB-0244">22-CCB-0244</a></td><td>-noninfringement</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffff">No claim certified, no orders to amend</td><td>Grand United Order of Oddfellows in American and Jurisdiction</td><td>Gavin Law Offices, PLC</td><td>Shawn O Cannon</td><td>Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/22-CCB-0243">22-CCB-0243</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>photographs, text, instruction manual of Paracord Bracelet Kit</td><td>The infringer is selling an exact replica of our Paracord Bracelet Kit product and duplicated our instruction manual.

Using my work in such a manner devalues it and makes it not as desirable to other potential local clients who may wish to license it properly for it's use. I originally sent them a very reasonable $4500.00 invoice for it's use, which equates to $100.00 a month. This is far below the regular retail license price of my video as seen on my licensing agency Nimia. Just one sequence of my video would license for $1000.00 a year for this type of use. They used the entire video containing 71 unique timelapse sequences. I was notified through email there would be no funds to pay me and that all the parties involved now work and run VistaSuite, another Wheaton, IL based tech company. They did make their website private a few days after I notified them of the unlawful use. Initial communications with them have met with negative results to pay my invoice.

No synchronization rights were obtained for the synchronization of the music to the film which was used for the live-streaming of the performance on each of the 5 occasions.

Additionally, they did not obtain public performance rights for the performances or the web streaming uses of the filmed work.

2) Smuin Ballet used my work to generate income for itself: admission fees, donations, and direct sponsorships from patrons.
3) for a composer, being able to tout and publicize the use of his work by a ballet company is a feather in his cap: it's validation of one's work. Smuin deprived me of the ability to publicize my involvement with this work and with their company, which is a known dance company in the world of contemporary ballet.

The normal penalty for unlicensed music use in the world of music publishing and master recordings is a 3x-10x fee penalty per infringing use. I initially proposed a 3x penalty of my normal fees for live performance/grand rights use and *no penalty multiplier* for the year-long use of the filmed performance on Smuin's website and social media sites. That total fee was $7000. Smuin rejected it saying they normally paid between $50 - $1500 for music use - which only confirmed my suspicion that Smuin is well aware of its legal obligation to license its music, and in this case, chose not to.

The Oddheader channel, as of this writing, has 770,000 subscribers and has been featured in a number of online entertainment press outlets such as Kotaku and NME for being the first to document and solve exclusive mysteries and discoveries in video games. 

The type of content in each of the original works produced by the Oddheader team involves hundreds of hours of labor spent doing numerous things such as talking to developers for the first time to get exclusive information about mysteries in games, modifying video game code to uncover never-before-seen details, and creatively composing and narrating scripted original works for publication. Every original work features new content from the subject video game that has never been published before Oddheader’s publication of the work, usually as a product of extensive research, composition, scripting, and edited material.

Doing so caused numerous damages to Oddheader and to the Oddheader brand. 

Appleby’s unauthorized use of the materials produced by the Oddheader channel was designed to intentionally misled his audience into thinking the original material was his own and to confuse the marketplace. It was an attempt to move traffic away from the Oddheader channel and to his own channel, T5G, using unauthorized, original, creative material originally produced by and for the Oddheader channel.

Respondent competes in a similar type of market and through infringement of Claimant's works has furthered Respondent's YouTube video channel at the diminished and expense of Claimant's YouTube video channel.  Claimant receives revenues from its channel generally through the number of subscribers, views and through paid membership.

They purposely ignored the nearly twenty minutes of compelling evidence presented in my original video and further called me an idiot, that I would be pissing my pants and various other derogatory terms while quickly dismissing me and my work to potentially their five plus million subscribers.

I have a book that I am releasing in the next few weeks, The Universe Loves You. This disparaging of my work to potential buyers of my book has been devastating to me personally and financially.

Thank you so much for the opportunity to present this matter before the CCB. Please find below a  brief background of the issue:

In March of 2015, I hired Mark Saxenmeyer of The Reporters Inc. a Minneapolis-based media production agency to assist with fundraising and perform certain production work for completion of my documentary film series titled: The Innocent Convicts. A fundraising contract and Project Assistance Area Agreement(see attached please) were drafted by The Reporters Inc. Executive Director, Mark Saxenmeyer which expressly provides ownership of all videos created for The Innocent Convicts project belong to me and my studio-Mankind Pictures. I paid the sum of $250 out of $500 which was due as project initiation fee as stated in that agreement. Although I initially titled the Project Tim Cole, The Innocent Man, I renamed it The Innocent Convicts in 2015 due to the need to include more stories to the Film project.

The foregoing harm is irreparable and is exacerbated by the fact that in the Infringing Restaurants and in associated marketing materials, JMC has intentionally displayed and reproduced the copyrighted images, characters, costumes, and character names, and derivative works thereof, from the Works.

They downloaded and removed my watermarks from a video that I created and shared on my own social media pages. I am a full-time content creator and make my living by selling content and by posting content. I get paid by social media platforms per like, view and share of my content. Additionally, I get paid in all future brand deals based on how many, followers, views and likes my profiles have. 

Doing Things Media, and their subsidiary Doggos Doing Things stole the video from my account, removed my watermarks, and shared it to their own account, amassing over 1.8 million views. They did not appropriately tag me nor ask my permission to use my content. I commented and messaged asking for appropriate credit, at the very least. My followers also began commenting on the post asking them to credit me. They deleted those comments. 

I then emailed them 2 times, once asking them to take the content down and twice with an invoice asking them to simply pay my content fee - the standard fee I charge for usage without watermarks or tagging.

Additionally, I have lost out on more than 1.8 million views which amounts to $720, or $.04 per view. 

The lost followers, likes, and views cannot be easily quantified because all of my future brand deals will now pay less as they have stolen those follows, likes, and views from me. Brands determine how much they will pay a partner based on engagement rate which is now marred because of these lost numbers.

On December 18, 2019, I discovered that my photograph of one of my original acrylic paintings was being used as the primary advertising photo to sell “BYOB” acrylic pour painting classes at a New York-based company called “The Paint Place” through the website CourseHorse.com.

They posted this photo in affiliation with multiple classes being held at least two different “The Paint Place” art studio locations in the New York City area throughout 2019 and 2020.

According to posts of class listings on CourseHorse.com for “BYOB Panting: Paint Pouring” that had my photograph posted on them, these classes were being sold at a price of $60 per person, had an “average of twenty students” per class, and were often listed as being “sold out”.

This photograph was of artwork that I created as part of an acrylic pour painting tutorial that I wrote and published exclusively on the arts & crafts website FeltMagnet.com on September 4th, 2018.

How to Do a Pour Painting: A Tutorial for Begin</td><td>CourseHorse.com and The Paint Place’s unauthorized commercial use of my photograph of my artwork that I’m using in current and future creative content and marketing not only reduces the value of my photo, but it implies a connection between myself and these companies that doesn’t exist.

The many “BYOB Painting: Paint Pouring” art classes at two New York City art studios being sold on CourseHorse.com and/or The Paint Place for $60 per person with twenty student classes over the course of multiple years, using my photograph as the primary advertising image on their websites, generated revenue for one or both of these companies that I received no compensation for.

Internet traffic to my painting tutorial article that includes this photograph has gone down in the last several years as search engines view a photo appearing on multiple websites as duplicate content and de-prioritize the site in search results, which reduces my earnings from this article.

Since Heart/The Beat is the earliest copyrighted recording of the two, it appears as if significant aspects of Mr. Brown's musical material and ideas, which also appear in ilomilo, have been appropriated by the creators of ilomilo without Mr. Brown's permission and have been incorporated into the recording of that song."</td><td>The respondents' co-opting of my work without attribution has deprived my ability to capitalize on the work.

"I am authorised to use the materials on this addresses as the materials published are available for public use and distribution in Chinese language. We translated these copies to English for our audience"

Respondent 2:
"I am not the owner, but I am authorized to use the content"
"Hello,
This item wasn't lifted from the quoted website, rather it's a material that's accessible in the public domain (although must use a translator to access it fully). We belong to a group where we have access to these materials to use, share, read, etc."

My book was NEVER translated. It was and still is only in English. I would know if my book was available in a different language. And it's a lie that the second respondent is authorize to use the material. I didn't and still don't authorize his use.

In addition, Claimant believes that WRCB-TV, which is an NBC Television affiliate, obtained the Photograph from some other entity within the NBC family of companies, which had many years earlier licensed the Photograph from Corbis/Getty Images. That license expired before WRCB-TV’s use and required the crediting of Claimant in connection with the license. Therefore, at the time of Respondent’s reproduction, display, and distribution of the Photograph on its website, Claimant had not granted Respondent any license or permission to reproduce, publicly display, or otherwise use the Photograph for any purpose. Further, Respondent omitted Claimant’s name from the infringing article, despite the expired license requiring authorship credit, therefore, inducing, facilitating, and encouraging further downstream infringement.

Respondents did not have any relationship or contract with Petitioner. Respondents completed the installation of the Copyrighted Work for NINE Dot Arts on the parking garage on or around July 17, 2020.
