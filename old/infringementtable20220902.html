The Works are original works of authorship, embodying copyrightable subject matter and subject to the full protection of the copyright laws of the United States.

Background of the Works:
 
Coming to America was a huge commercial success and the second highest-grossing movie of 1988, and remains immensely popular despite premiering over 30 years ago. See Exhibit 2 https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/1988/.

To make matters worse, the quality of the food is in serious question, as consumers have reported feeling discomfort after eating at the Infringing Restaurant. See Exhibit 25.
 
The foregoing harm is irreparable and is exacerbated by the fact that in the Infringing Restaurants and in associated marketing materials, JMC has intentionally displayed and reproduced the copyrighted images, characters, costumes, and character names, and derivative works thereof, from the Works.  
 
JMC created, displayed, and reproduced the Infringing Materials willfully, and in knowing disregard of Paramount Pictures’ copyrights, of which JMC was on notice long before it began its infringing conduct.
 
On information and belief, all of JMC’s conduct described herein has been and continues to be willful, wanton, and in bad faith, and none has been with the authorization or consent of Paramount Pictures.

Copying and reproducing "Sunglass Corner" in any way, reduces its value. My collectors bought and paid for the emotional sentiment evoked by this image- four elderly men from a different time standing as present day sentries to the Village of Harlem, New York. The high contrast and soft grainy texture is indicative of the style I've created, by using the same materials in processing and printing my images. Reproducing the image cheapens and devalues it tremendously. I've invested years, time and money honing my craft and skill as a self-taught photographer.

My followers also began commenting on the post asking them to credit me. They deleted those comments.

Additionally, I have lost out on more than 1.8 million views which amounts to $720, or $.04 per view.

On December 18, 2019, I discovered that my photograph of one of my original acrylic paintings was being used as the primary advertising photo to sell “BYOB” acrylic pour painting classes at a New York-based company called “The Paint Place” through the website CourseHorse.com.

They posted this photo in affiliation with multiple classes being held at least two different “The Paint Place” art studio locations in the New York City area throughout 2019 and 2020.

According to posts of class listings on CourseHorse.com for “BYOB Panting: Paint Pouring” that had my photograph posted on them, these classes were being sold at a price of $60 per person, had an “average of twenty students” per class, and were often listed as being “sold out”.

This photograph was of artwork that I created as part of an acrylic pour painting tutorial that I wrote and published exclusively on the arts & crafts website FeltMagnet.com on September 4th, 2018.

How to Do a Pour Painting: A Tutorial for Begin</td><td>CourseHorse.com and The Paint Place’s unauthorized commercial use of my photograph of my artwork that I’m using in current and future creative content and marketing not only reduces the value of my photo, but it implies a connection between myself and these companies that doesn’t exist.

The many “BYOB Painting: Paint Pouring” art classes at two New York City art studios being sold on CourseHorse.com and/or The Paint Place for $60 per person with twenty student classes over the course of multiple years, using my photograph as the primary advertising image on their websites, generated revenue for one or both of these companies that I received no compensation for.

Internet traffic to my painting tutorial article that includes this photograph has gone down in the last several years as search engines view a photo appearing on multiple websites as duplicate content and de-prioritize the site in search results, which reduces my earnings from this article.

"I am authorised to use the materials on this addresses as the materials published are available for public use and distribution in Chinese language. We translated these copies to English for our audience"

Respondent 2:
"I am not the owner, but I am authorized to use the content"
"Hello,
This item wasn't lifted from the quoted website, rather it's a material that's accessible in the public domain (although must use a translator to access it fully). We belong to a group where we have access to these materials to use, share, read, etc."

My book was NEVER translated. It was and still is only in English. I would know if my book was available in a different language. And it's a lie that the second respondent is authorize to use the material. I didn't and still don't authorize his use.

I sent a resume in response. (I worked at E! Entertainment Television on the non-fiction series “Celebrity Profile” and “True Hollywood Story,” and had written several award show red carpet scripts for TV Guide Network.) 

I heard back quickly from the producer, Tara Pirnia. She needed a short turnaround on a script for a show about the fashion evolution of Kate Middleton. When I quoted a price of $1000, she talked me into lowering it by half to $500, saying that it was the pilot for a series and she would pay me more for the next script. I agreed. 

She sent me a rough outline that included bullet points for each segment, divided up into nine blocks plus a cold open. After researching and writing the script, I submitted my first draft with my original title “Kate Middleton: Duchess of Style.” Tara praised my work in subsequent emails. She seemed pleased with my writing. I stayed in touch with Tara during the revision process, and she gave me additional note</td><td>I am entitled to damages because this was no accident. Tara Pirnia has practiced this kind of fraud and deception before. In documentation which I will attach I will demonstrate that she has a history of legal actions being brought against her to collect on rents, wages, and other monies that went unpaid due to her repeated deliberate actions meant to defraud others. Copies of these complaints are attached, as well as a list of all small claims cases brought against her.

As recently as 2021, a complaint was filed by Amanda Raymond, the writer and director of a feature film Tara Pirnia produced. The cause of action was breach of contract. In the complaint the Amanda Raymond states that Tara Pirnia had no intention of paying the deferred compensation, contingent compensation or travel expenses as outlined in her contract. A copy of the complaint is attached.
