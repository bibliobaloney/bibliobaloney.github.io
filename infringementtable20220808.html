I added audio and text and shared to my tiktok and Instagram pages</td><td>A massive media agency stole my content and is profiting of f it. They downloaded and removed my watermarks from a video that I created and shared on my own social media pages. I am a full-time content creator and make my living by selling content and by posting content. I get paid by social media platforms per like, view and share of my content. Additionally, I get paid in all future brand deals based on how many, followers, views and likes my profiles have. 

Doing Things Media, and their subsidiary Doggos Doing Things stole the video from my account, removed my watermarks, and shared it to their own account, amassing over 1.8 million views. They did not appropriately tag me nor ask my permission to use my content. I commented and messaged asking for appropriate credit, at the very least. My followers also began commenting on the post asking them to credit me. They deleted those comments. 

I then emailed them 2 times, once asking them to take the content down and twice with an invoice asking them to simply pay my content fee - the standard fee I charge for usage without watermarks or tagging.

On December 18, 2019, I discovered that my photograph of one of my original acrylic paintings was being used as the primary advertising photo to sell “BYOB” acrylic pour painting classes at a New York-based company called “The Paint Place” through the website CourseHorse.com.

They posted this photo in affiliation with multiple classes being held at least two different “The Paint Place” art studio locations in the New York City area throughout 2019 and 2020.

According to posts of class listings on CourseHorse.com for “BYOB Panting: Paint Pouring” that had my photograph posted on them, these classes were being sold at a price of $60 per person, had an “average of twenty students” per class, and were often listed as being “sold out”.

This photograph was of artwork that I created as part of an acrylic pour painting tutorial that I wrote and published exclusively on the arts & crafts website FeltMagnet.com on September 4th, 2018.

An expert's analysis is summarized in this excerpt:
 "... this researcher concludes that these similarities have not occurred by chance or by coincidence. Therefore, they must have occurred by design. Since Heart/The Beat is the earliest copyrighted recording of the two, it appears as if significant aspects of Mr. Brown's musical material and ideas, which also appear in ilomilo, have been appropriated by the creators of ilomilo without Mr. Brown's permission and have been incorporated into the recording of that song."</td><td>Jarhid A Brown</td><td>none</td><td>Billie E Eilish</td><td>Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/22-CCB-0084">22-CCB-0084</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>My own original music and lyrics all of which I wrote, composed, and recorded with my own voice and my piano.</td><td>In 2003, according to product labeling, Hasbro, Inc., without my informed consent, virtually trademarked a reproduction of the fable genre, symbolism, and fictional characterization, not just the title, of my own original June 1971 Unity Wee Wisdom (page 35) poem, The Groovy Pig, into the fable character plastic figurine toy, Groovy Peppa, a model of the Hasbro, Inc. trademarked Peppa Pig figurine line of retail toy products. As a result, I see the toy as a reproduction of my poem in that such fable character figurine is an anthropomorphic pig dressed up like a typical housewife with a guitar to be a rock star, whereas my poetic fable depicts an anthropomorphic sheep as a good samaritan giving up fleece to an anthropomorphic pig on the phone like a typical shopper with the fleece as a wig to be somebody.</td><td>Stephen M Richards</td><td>none</td><td>Hasbro, Inc.</td><td>Order Denying Request to Link Stephen M Richards with the Hasbro, Inc. and Stephen M Richards parties</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/22-CCB-0083">22-CCB-0083</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>Composition</td><td>The infringers willfully used my compositions without leasing or exclusive rights.

Claimant then licensed the Photo, non-exclusively, to Smuggling Duds on Oct. 1, 2012.
Smuggling Duds added its logos (“Logos”) to the Photo, as permitted under its license, prior to its publication of the Photo.
Smuggling Duds published the Photo with Logos on the Smuggling Duds website, at https://smugglingduds.com/blogs/news/at-the-ufc-weigh-ins-with-dan-the-outlaw-hardy-and-jimi-the-posterboy-manuwa, on October 2, 2012, under its license (it is still visible at that URL).

I received a payment in 2011 of $3,497, and in 2012 I got $935.40 and in 2013 $809.60, but then the payments stopped. However I saw the books in their Mud Puddle packaging in stores all over the country.  So I called and e-mailed Greg repeatedly and asked for an accounting, but he stone-walled me, probably knowing it would be too expensive for me to hire an attorney to sue him.  However you can see that they are still selling the book and the kit although they sometimes misspell my name to Finnegan on the cover.
