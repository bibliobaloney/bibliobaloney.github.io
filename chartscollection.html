    <h2 id="fds">Final Determinations</h2>
    <p>Per the <a href="https://ccb.gov/proceedings/">CCB website</a>, "A CCB proceeding becomes 
        'active' after the claimant has filed proof of service with the CCB, and the respondent 
        ... has not opted out within the required time (usually sixty days). ...
        After parties have submitted their written testimony and any hearings have been held, 
        the CCB will issue its final determination."</p>

    <h2 id="active">Active Cases</h2>
    <p>Per the <a href="https://ccb.gov/proceedings/">CCB website</a>, "A CCB proceeding becomes 
        'active' after the claimant has filed proof of service with the CCB, and the respondent 
        ... has not opted out within the required time (usually sixty days)." Once a final 
        determination is issued, a case is no longer active.</p>

    <h3>Smaller claims</h3>
    <p>"When total damages sought in a claim do not exceed $5,000 (exclusive of attorneys' fees and 
        costs), a claimant may request consideration under the CCB's 
        <a href="https://ccb.gov/faq/#fivethousand">“Smaller Claims”</a> procedures. 
        Smaller Claims will be decided by a single Copyright Claims Officer, but the determination 
        will have the same effect as one issued by the full CCB. These types of cases are even more 
        streamlined than the typical cases before the CCB."</p>

    <h2 id="works">Infringement Claims: Works Allegedly Infringed</h2>
    <p>The database only includes information on works from infringement claims. Some claims list multiple 
        works. The data here describes all works listed in all infringement claims, not just, e.g., 
        the first listed work.

    <h3>Registration</h3>
    <p>For works allegedly infringed, did the claimant assert that they had a registration number, 
        or an request number (for apending registration application)?

    <h2 id="otas">Orders to Amend</h2>
    <p>This data was collected by scraping all relevant headings from all publicly availble documents
        matching the type "Order to Amend Noncompliant Claim." The problems with claims can vary widely,
        and the attorneys writing the orders to amend aren't limited to a predefined set of headings. 
        Because of that, similar reasons/headings appear in the table below. The full list of headings 
        found, and counts for each, is provided at the end of the page for those who want to do their own 
        analysis. Contact me at bibliobaloney@duck.com if you'd like me to pull a set from the database 
        that's limited to a particular date range.
