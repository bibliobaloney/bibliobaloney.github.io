25-CCB-0128,Cuestas v. DiGiAnnounce,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/12735,"""I swear under penalty of perjury that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled by mistake or because of misidentification of the material.""

Explanation of the Misrepresentation:

This statement is a misrepresentation because the material was not removed by mistake or misidentified. The listing in question was a derivative copy of my original, copyrighted pregnancy announcement. My work was created using real, physical props photographed in a 3D flat-lay scene, while the infringing design was generated using AI to replicate my composition, styling, and layout.

The infringer’s claim of a good faith belief is not supported by facts. She deliberately mimicked my design with slight alterations, resulting in a product that was clearly based on my original work. This is not a case of accidental use or misidentification—it was a willful and knowing infringement.

Her counter notice contains no explanation, evidence, or distinguishing features to support her claim that the removal was in error. The language used is a generic DMCA response, and in this case, it falsely represents the situation and attempts to justify unauthorized use of my copyrighted design. 
Additionally, I have reason to believe the address provided in the counter notice may be false or intentionally misleading. The counter notice lists a U.S. address in Jasper, Oregon (36763 Jasper Lowell Rd), but based on the nature of the account, activity patterns, and language used in the shop, I suspect the seller may be operating under a false identity or from a different location altogether.

Providing a false name or address in a DMCA counter notice is a serious misrepresentation and a violation of the DMCA's requirements for truthful disclosure. This further supports my claim that the counter notice was made in bad faith and that the infringing material should not be reinstated.","The counter notice submitted by the infringing party contained a false statement of good faith belief that the material was removed in error. This misrepresentation caused additional stress, time, and financial burden on me as the original copyright holder.

Because of this counter notice, I am now forced to take legal action to prevent the infringing listing from being reinstated. This would not have been necessary if the infringer had not submitted a counter notice based on a knowingly false claim. Additionally, the infringer may have provided false or misleading contact information, which complicates proper legal service and further undermines the integrity of the DMCA process.
The misrepresentation also delays the enforcement of my copyright rights.

Relief Sought:
I am seeking:
A finding that the counter notice was submitted in bad faith and contained material misrepresentations.

Monetary damages to compensate for the time, costs, and harm incurred due to the misrepresentation.

A permanent order preventing the infringer from reposting the infringing material or submitting further fraudulent counter notices."
25-CCB-0106,Pugh v. Brown,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/12509,"Brown’s statement that he had a ""good faith belief"" that my DMCA takedown request was mistaken or a misidentification is a misrepresentation because he knew, or should have known, that he had no legal right to use my copyrighted work, ""Imma Let You Go,"" in his song ""You Do You."" I am the registered copyright owner of ""Imma Let You Go"" (Registration Number: SR 936-864, Effective Date: July 20, 2022), and a prior court hearing in Idaho (small claims case filed October 14, 2022) determined that Brown is not the original creator of the work. Additionally, DistroKid LLC issued a DMCA takedown notice (Request #7373092, dated October 24, 2022) to Brown, instructing him to remove all versions of ""You Do You"" from digital streaming platforms due to the infringement, and Brown refused to comply, leading DistroKid to remove the content.

Despite this clear evidence of infringement, Brown filed a counter-notification with SoundCloud, asserting a ""good faith belief"" that my takedown was mistaken, without claiming ownership of the copyright or providing any legal basis for his use of my work. This statement was knowingly false, as Brown was aware of the prior DistroKid’s takedown notice, both of which confirmed his lack of rights to my work. His misrepresentation caused material harm by leading SoundCloud to reinstate the infringing content after the 10-business-day window passed, allowing Brown to continue violating my copyright. This has resulted in potential lost revenue and licensing opportunities for my work, as well as the costs I’ve incurred to pursue this CCB claim (e.g., filing fees of $100 and time spent addressing the infringement). I request that the CCB award damages for this misrepresentation, in addition to the remedies sought for my copyright infringement claim.","In 2025, Brown filed a counter-notification with SoundCloud (dispute ID# 108243967) that contained a false statement—namely, his assertion of a ""good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification."" Brown did not claim ownership of the copyright to ""Imma Let You Go"" or provide any legal basis (e.g., a license or fair use) for his use of my work, yet he filed the counter-notification, knowing he had no right to use my song. This misrepresentation led SoundCloud to reinstate the infringing content after the 10-business-day window passed, exacerbating the harm from the infringement:

Continued Infringement Due to Reinstatement: The reinstatement of ""You Do You"" on SoundCloud in 2025 allowed Brown to continue infringing on my copyright, adding to the financial harm already caused over the previous four years. This extended period of infringement, enabled by Brown’s false counter-notification, has further diluted the market for my work and caused additional lost revenue, which I estimate at $1,000–$2,000 for the period following the reinstatement (e.g., additional streams or exposure that Brown gained at my expense).
Costs of Pursuing This CCB Claim: Brown’s misrepresentation forced me to take additional legal action to protect my rights, including filing this CCB claim in 2025. I have incurred direct costs, such as the CCB filing fees ($100 total, with $40 paid initially and $60 due if the case becomes active), and potential service fees (estimated at $50–$100 if I need to hire a process server to serve Brown, as I do not have his address). Additionally, I have spent significant time preparing this claim, which I estimate at 10 hours. Valuing my time at a modest rate of $50 per hour, this amounts to $500 in lost productivity. These costs, totaling $650–$700, would not have been necessary if Brown had not filed a false counter-notification, as SoundCloud would have kept the content removed.
Emotional and Professional Burden: The need to pursue this CCB claim in 2025, after four years of dealing with Brown’s infringement, has added to the emotional and professional stress I’ve endured since 2021. I have been forced to divert even more time and resources from my creative work to address his ongoing infringement and misrepresentation, compounding the frustration and exhaustion caused by this prolonged ordeal.
In summary, Brown’s actions over four years (2021–2025) have caused me significant financial harm (lost revenue and licensing opportunities estimated at $11,000–$17,000), professional harm (damage to my reputation and artistic control), direct costs (CCB filing fees, time, and service fees totaling $650–$700), and emotional distress. The prior actions by DistroKid and other DSPs to remove Brown’s infringing content since 2022 demonstrate that his use is unauthorized, yet his persistence—enabled by the false counter-notification in 2025—has prolonged and exacerbated the harm to me.

Relief Sought
I seek the following relief from the CCB to address the harm caused by Brown’s copyright infringement and misrepresentation, totaling $29,000 in damages, which reflects the severe and prolonged impact of his actions over four years (2021–2025):

For the Copyright Infringement Claim:

Statutory Damages: I request statutory damages of $25,000 for the infringement of ""Imma Let You Go."" This amount is warranted due to the willful and prolonged nature of Brown’s infringement, which has persisted since 2021—four years of continuous violation of my copyright. Brown’s willfulness is evidenced by his refusal to comply with the DistroKid DMCA takedown notice (Request #7373092, dated October 24, 2022), the prior court determination in Idaho (small claims case filed October 14, 2022) that he is not the original creator, and his baseless counter-notification to SoundCloud in 2025 that did not claim ownership or provide any legal basis for his use. The CCB allows statutory damages of up to $15,000 per work for registered works, and I believe the maximum is appropriate given the duration and severity of the infringement. However, to fit within my total damages request of $29,000, I am allocating $25,000 to this claim, reflecting the significant financial, professional, and emotional harm caused over four years.
Cease Infringing Activity: I request that the CCB include in its determination a requirement that Brown cease distributing ""You Do You"" and any other releases that infringe on ""Imma Let You Go"" on all platforms, including SoundCloud, YouTube, TikTok, and others. I understand that the CCB cannot issue a binding injunction, but I seek this determination to prevent further harm to my intellectual property rights, with the expectation that Brown will agree to comply. A CCB determination of infringement will also enable me to request removal from other platforms through their DMCA processes, building on the precedent set by DistroKid and other DSPs that have already removed Brown’s infringing content since 2022. My ultimate goal is to ensure that all of Brown’s releases that infringe on my song are removed from all platforms, restoring my control over my work.
For the Misrepresentation Claim under the DMCA:

Damages for Costs Incurred: I request damages of $2,000 to cover the direct costs and additional harm caused by Brown’s false counter-notification in 2025, which led to the reinstatement of the infringing content and forced me to file this CCB claim. These costs include the CCB filing fees ($100 total), the estimated value of my time spent preparing this claim (10 hours at $50/hour, totaling $500), and potential service fees ($50–$100 to serve Brown, as I do not have his address). This totals $650–$700 in direct costs. Additionally, the reinstatement allowed Brown to continue infringing, causing further lost revenue, which I estimate at $1,300–$1,350 for the period following the reinstatement (e.g., additional streams or exposure Brown gained at my expense in 2025). Together, these amounts total $2,000, which I believe is a fair compensation for the harm caused by the misrepresentation.
Additional Damages for Prolonged Harm: The misrepresentation exacerbated the harm from the infringement by allowing Brown to continue his unauthorized use in 2025, adding to the four-year ordeal I’ve endured since 2021. This prolonged harm is reflected in the emotional and professional burden of having to pursue this claim, which I’ve factored into the damages for the infringement claim but also note here as a contributing factor to the overall impact of Brown’s actions.
Total Relief Sought: I seek total damages of $29,000, comprising $25,000 in statutory damages for the copyright infringement and $4,000 for the misrepresentation (covering my direct costs, lost revenue, and the additional harm caused by the reinstatement). The $29,000 reflects the cumulative impact of four years of infringement (2021–2025), the willful nature of Brown’s actions, and the exacerbation of harm caused by his false counter-notification in 2025. Additionally, I request a determination that Brown cease distributing ""You Do You"" and any other infringing releases on all platforms, to prevent further harm and allow me to fully enforce my rights across digital service providers."

Vakker Light",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/12388,"The misrepresentation states, ""I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the affected content was removed as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the content to be removed.""

Claimant previously provided Respondent with a copy of its copyright registration for the subject work.  The works are virtually identical.  Respondent has decided to ignore Claimant's assertion of copyrights and the law under the U.S. Copyright Act.  Respondent misrepresented that it had a good faith belief that the content was removed because of mistake or misidentification.","Due to the submission of Respondent’s fraudulent counter-notice, the infringing content will be reinstated within days, forcing Claimant to incur legal fees to initiate this proceeding (or a federal lawsuit) to prevent continued public access to the infringing content. Without this action, the infringing product would remain publicly available for display and sale, causing ongoing harm.

As a result of Respondent’s actions, Claimant has suffered the following damages: (1) Financial harm, including lost revenue and attorneys' fees and costs; (2) Reputational harm, including diminished value of Claimant's works and loss of perceived exclusivity; and (3) Harm to the work's valuation, specifically, the diminished value of Claimant's original work."
25-CCB-0086,"Latkovic v. Amazon.com Services LLC, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/12258,"1. Amazon’s Misrepresentation:

Amazon falsely claimed:
- ""Third-party sellers are permitted to resell copies they have legally acquired.""
- ""We cannot remove these legitimate secondary market listings.""

Misrepresentation Explanation:
Amazon failed to acknowledge that I have unpublished my books from Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) and no longer authorize any sales. It is impossible for new copies to be entering circulation legitimately.
The listings falsely imply that these are still actively available books, misleading customers and damaging my control over my intellectual property.

2. Goodreads’ Misrepresentation:
Goodreads falsely claimed:
- ""We do not remove listings of books that were once validly published.""
Misrepresentation Explanation:
Goodreads presents itself as a book database, not a retail store, yet refuses to remove books even after their publication rights have been revoked.     This falsely implies my books are still in circulation, causing reputational harm. Goodreads is not a legal archive—they are actively choosing to keep infringing materials online against my explicit requests.

3. Google’s Misrepresentation:
Google falsely claimed:
- ""We are unsure whether you are authorized to submit a copyright removal request.""
Misrepresentation Explanation:
I provided official copyright registrations from the U.S. Copyright Office proving my ownership. I also provided metadata, screenshots, ISBN records, and takedown requests.

Despite overwhelming proof, Google refused to de-index the infringing pages, enabling continued exposure of my works.","I have suffered financial, professional, and emotional harm due to these companies' refusal to honor my copyright takedown requests:

Financial Harm:
- Unauthorized third-party sellers on Amazon profit from my work while I receive nothing.
- Misleading listings misrepresent my publishing status, impacting potential future deals.

Reputational Harm:
- Goodreads and Google continue to associate me with outdated works, preventing me from moving forward under a new professional identity.
 - False listings damage credibility among potential publishers, agents, and industry professionals.

Emotional Distress & Legal Burden:
- The refusal to comply with basic DMCA procedures has caused weeks of frustration, requiring me to exhaust administrative and legal measures to protect my own work.
- The deliberate stonewalling and misrepresentations by these companies show a reckless disregard for copyright law.

Relief Sought:
- Immediate removal of Tycho Brahe Secret and Jung’s Demon from Amazon, Goodreads, and Google Search.
- Damages for financial and reputational harm caused by willful misrepresentation and refusal to comply with DMCA.
- An injunction preventing these companies from relisting or redistributing my works in the future without my explicit authorization."
25-CCB-0078,Makulevskii v. Yuanping,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/12171,"The seller, VGYGLS, submitted a DMCA counter-notice that included the following false statement:
""I have a good faith belief that the material identified in the Notice of Infringement was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. I therefore request that the material be replaced and/or no longer disabled.""
This statement constitutes a misrepresentation for the following reasons:
1.	Direct Copying of My Work
The infringing product listed by VGYGLS is an unauthorized reproduction of my original sculptural work. The infringer has copied key creative elements, including:
o	The stem has two bends identical to my original sculpture.
o	The relief of the leaves matches my work.
o	The bronze color, which is a distinctive and intentional artistic choice in my creation.
2.	Registered Copyright Ownership
I created this sculpture, and I hold the registered copyright (Attachment A) VA0002353500. This registration grants me the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display my work under Title 17, Chapter 1, § 102 of the United States Copyright Act.
3.	Violation of My Exclusive Rights
Under § 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act, I hold the exclusive rights to:
o	Reproduce my copyrighted work.
o	Create and distribute derivative works.
o	Publicly display and distribute copies of my sculpture.
The seller, VGYGLS, has unlawfully exercised these rights without authorization, falsely claiming non-infringement.
4.	Abuse of the DMCA Counter-Notice System
Under Title 2, § 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA):
o	VGYGLS knowingly made a false representation by claiming that the removal of the infringing material was due to a mistake or misidentification.
o	This constitutes an abuse of the DMCA notice-and-takedown process in an attempt to retain an infringing listing unlawfully.
5.	Harm and Statutory Damages
According to Chapter 5, § 504 of the U.S. Copyright Act, I am entitled to:
o	Statutory damages ranging from $750 to $30,000 per infringement, as determined by the court.
o	Compensation for the financial and reputational harm caused by the unauthorized use of my work.
Request for Immediate Action
Given this clear misrepresentation and copyright infringement, I request that:
1.	Amazon permanently removes the infringing listing and prevents its reinstatement.
2.	Amazon takes action against VGYGLS for abusing the DMCA counter-notice system and submitting a false statement.
3.	Amazon enforces stricter compliance measures to prevent future abuses of the DMCA process.
I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and expect corrective action as soon as possible. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide an update on the actions Amazon will take to address this issue.","Injunction: A court order to cease the sale and distribution of the infringing works by the respondent.Monetary Compensation: Payment of $2,000 for the infringement of my copyright.Reimbursement of Legal Costs: Compensation for legal fees and expenses of $500 incurred in pursuing this claim."

Our company is the original creator of this sculpture and holds a registered copyright. The infringing product replicates several distinctive creative elements of our work, including:
•	The form and positioning of the stem: The infringer's sculpture features a stem with two bends, mirroring our original design.
•	The rose leaves: The leaves in the infringer’s sculpture share the same shape and relief as ours.
•	The rosebud: The curvature and structure of the rosebud in the infringer’s sculpture are identical to our original creation.
•	The rose color: The infringer uses a bronze finish, which is a unique artistic choice in our work.

By reproducing and selling these works, both Bohdana Stepanenko and Maryna Kosarieva are deceiving Etsy representatives and misleading customers, who believe they are purchasing original pieces. This has resulted in:
•	Significant financial losses for my business.
•	Reputational damage, as customers are unaware that I am the original creator.
•	Violation of my exclusive rights under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act and infringement under Section 501.
The arrangement, composition, and color palette in my stained glass works are the result of my creative effort and meet the originality requirements for copyright protection. These designs are unique, do not rely on publicly available patterns or templates, and are not typical of conventional stained glass works.
This unauthorized reproduction and sale of my works have caused confusion among consumers, diminished the value of my brand, and harmed my ability to profit from my original creations.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please take appropriate action to address this copyright infringement.","Removal of the infringing listings from the respondent's Etsy shop.
Statutory damages in the amount of $2,000 for the infringement of my copyrighted designs.
Reimbursement of legal costs and attorney's fees in the amount of $500."
24-CCB-0370,Late Night Crew LLC v. Torain,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/11014,"Words: ""The respondent took the video from my YouTube channel (without permission) via a process called ripping the file."" (Claim made with the CCB on 11/23/2024 at 4:22 PM EST).

Explanation: This statement is a misrepresentation because the claimant offers no evidence to support their claim about how I obtained the video. My video is not simply a re-upload of the claimant's video. It includes a substantial amount of original content, including a 20-minute introduction and monologue preceding any use of the claimant's material. This transformative use of the claimant's content contradicts their assertion that I merely ""ripped the file.""

2. Misrepresentation regarding the extent of copyrighted work used:

Words: ""One hundred percent of my copyrighted work is being used in the reported video."" (Claim made with the CCB on 11/23/2024 at 4:22 PM EST).

Explanation: This statement is demonstrably false. The claimant's own takedown notice contradicts this claim by specifying that the allegedly infringing content is limited to the timestamps of 0:26:55 – 0:44:50, totaling less than 20 minutes. Furthermore, the claimant's video is 2 hours long, while my video is 4 hours long. It is mathematically impossible for 100% of a 2-hour video to be contained within a 20-minute segment of a longer work.","As a direct result of the false takedown notice, I suffered the following harm:

Financial Loss: The removal of my video resulted in a loss of ad revenue and potential new viewers. 
Reputational Harm: The false claim of copyright infringement damaged my reputation as a content creator within the YouTube community.
To remedy this harm, I request the following:

Statutory Damages: $5,000 to compensate for lost revenue, damage to reputation, and the time and effort spent addressing this false claim. This amount also covers any legal fees incurred.
Declaration of Misrepresentation: A formal declaration from the CCB stating that the takedown notice contained false information.
Retraction of the Notice: An order requiring the claimant to retract the false takedown notice.
Injunction: An injunction prohibiting the claimant from submitting further DMCA takedown notices against any content on my YouTube channel, including videos, live streams, community posts, and Shorts. This is necessary to prevent further harassment and disruption of my content creation activities.
I also request any other relief that the CCB deems just and proper in this matter."
24-CCB-0365,Royale v. Smith,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/10939,"Zion Smith’s counter-notification is misleading and contains several inaccurate claims that distort the true nature of the dispute. While Zion asserts that we are in a legal dispute over the song’s royalties, the takedown notice was not for the entire song but was specifically filed for my verse, which comprised 1 minute and 55 seconds of the track. The DMCA takedown was solely focused on removing my copyrighted material, not the entire composition. Furthermore, Zion’s claim that we share equal rights to the song and that I am attempting to claim 100% of the royalties misrepresents the nature of our agreement and the actual issue at hand—my intellectual property and my right to control its use. The statement that we are currently in court over the song is misleading, as the ongoing legal proceedings are related to a restraining order, not the song’s copyright or royalty dispute. Additionally, Zion’s claim that she has documents to prove her position is vague and lacks specific evidence, further confusing the issue. Moreover, her assertion that I gave her consent to use my copyrighted material is false. I clearly communicated that I had withdrawn my participation and revoked any implied permission to use my work. Finally, the counter-notification’s claim that the takedown was a mistake is untrue, as the takedown notice was based on a legitimate and valid claim of copyright infringement. The content removed was exclusively my verse, and the purpose of my takedown was to protect my intellectual property rights.","The counter-notification submitted by Zion Smith has caused significant harm to my reputation, my intellectual property rights, and my financial standing. By falsely claiming that I had granted her permission to use my copyrighted material and misrepresenting the nature of the dispute, Zion has perpetuated confusion and undermined my efforts to protect my work. Her claims that we are in a legal dispute over royalties are misleading and have distorted the true issue, which is the unauthorized use of my verse. This false narrative not only damages my professional image but also creates a misleading record of events that could affect future business relationships and opportunities.

Additionally, the counter-notification has resulted in ongoing harm by facilitating the reinstatement of the infringing content on YouTube. Despite my lawful takedown of the video, Zion’s actions, combined with the false counter-notification, have allowed the video to be restored, enabling her to continue profiting from my work without proper compensation or authorization. This ongoing infringement has resulted in a loss of potential revenue and opportunities that I would have rightfully earned had my intellectual property been respected.

Moreover, Zion’s actions have caused unnecessary financial strain. After she filed for a restraining order, which was ultimately denied by the court, I was forced to incur legal fees to defend myself against the baseless claims. The false restraining order not only resulted in unnecessary court costs but also delayed resolution of the infringement issue. As a result, I have been further financially burdened, facing both the costs of defending my rights and the continuing harm to my career and intellectual property.

Given the extent of the harm caused by these actions, I respectfully request the court to award statutory damages as provided under copyright law. These damages are necessary to compensate for the losses I have incurred, deter further infringements, and help recover the financial costs of defending my rights against the false claims made in the counter-notification and the restraining order."
24-CCB-0358,Tate v. Crofton,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/10875,"I don't know the wording of the notices Aeronwen sent the online providers; however, the providers used words like ""don't post things you don't have the rights to."" Crofton is pushing the notion that I have no rights to post the music video we made together. I believe she is either not stating it was a collaboration with me or outright claiming I had nothing to do with it. I truly don't know the actual wording. I sense it's very simple without her going into any detail as to why.","1. 9 months of work without pay with nothing to show, not even the ability to put it on my website. Work was lost because of it.
2. Months spent trying to understand if what Crofton was doing was legal or not —hiring a lawyer for legal advice.
3. YouTube demerit for copyright infringement.
4. It is difficult to convey how it feels to be utterly disrespected, to have my time, my years of experience, and my humanity dismissed.

I don't believe the CCB has the power to provide damages based on the lost work, lost time, and months of emotional stress, but it would certainly be nice to -- once and for all -- be granted the rights to something I worked my butt off for, a music video Lynn claims was made without her consent when, in fact, she was the driving force behind the collaboration from day one."
24-CCB-0355,Rybak v. Stepanenko,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/10844,"I swear under penalty of perjury that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled by mistake or because of misidentification of the material.
However, the above statement made in the counter-notice submitted by Bohdana Stepanenko, owner of the Etsy shop GlassSunLight, is false and misleading. I believe that she is intentionally deceiving Etsy representatives and potential buyers by claiming that the removal of the content was mistaken or due to misidentification.
The product Bohdana Stepanenko is selling in her shop is a direct copy of my original work, for which I am the sole creator and rights holder. Specifically, her product exactly replicates the unique patterns on the butterfly wings, the arrangement of elements, the color scheme, the lines, and the overall shape of the butterfly. These elements result from my creative expression and are protected by copyright law.
By selling this copied work, Bohdana Stepanenko is misleading Etsy representatives with her false claims and deceiving customers who believe they are purchasing an original piece. This has caused significant harm to my business and infringes upon my intellectual property rights.

Additionally, the public remains unaware that I am the original creator of these works, leading to confusion among customers and damage to my brand's reputation.","As a result of the alleged infringement by the respondent, I have suffered significant harm, both financially and reputationally. The unauthorized copying of my stained glass sculptural works has led to a direct loss of sales and potential income. I have not received any compensation or royalties for the unauthorized use of my creations, which undermines my ability to sustain my artistic practice and livelihood.

Moreover, the presence of the respondent's copied works in the market creates confusion among consumers, as they may mistakenly associate my original designs with the inferior quality of the copied pieces. This not only damages my reputation as an artist but also diminishes the perceived value of my work. My original creations are the result of extensive time, effort, and creativity, and seeing them reproduced without my consent dilutes my brand and artistic identity.

In light of these harms, I am seeking the following relief:
Injunction: A court order to cease the sale and distribution of the infringing works by the respondent.
Monetary Compensation: A payment of $2,000 for the infringement of my copyright.
Reimbursement of Legal Costs: Compensation for legal fees and expenses amounting to $500, which have been incurred in the process of pursuing this claim."
24-CCB-0340,Robertson v. Johnson,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/10574,"The misrepresentation in Nicole Johnson's (Treezus) statement arises from her claim that ""TREEZUS is the creator and owner of the content uploaded."" The key words that constitute the misrepresentation are ""creator"" and ""owner,"" as these words falsely assert her authorship and legal rights over the content in question. The misrepresentation is further underscored by the fact that YouTube's content ID system alerted me to the presence of my music in her videos, indicating my rightful ownership. Nicole Johnson's admission of my ownership in another context, juxtaposed with her contradictory claim to YouTube, exemplifies a deliberate attempt to mislead YouTube into reinstating the content under false pretenses of ownership.","Due to Nicole Johnson's unauthorized use of my intellectual property and her subsequent misrepresentation, I have endured substantial harm. Johnson wrongfully asserted ownership over my work, ""Dani Montana (Instrumental),"" in a counter-notice to YouTube on February 23, 2024. Her false claims have significantly undermined my copyright, leading to a dilution in the market value of my work and complicating its copyright enforcement. Moreover, these assertions have inflicted reputational damage by publicly challenging my ownership, which could lead others to doubt the legitimacy of my rights. Consequently, these actions have inflicted emotional distress and financial losses, necessitating legal measures to address these infringements and defend my copyright. In light of these circumstances, I am seeking $1,200 in relief.
Additionally, I request that the following YouTube videos be permanently refrained from being reinstated to YouTube.com:

24-CCB-0336,Stovin v. Rodriguez,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/10522,"I spent a great deal of time creating a logo for several shirts I wanted to create.  Each of these designs featured central components which were two circle/rings, with white spackle ""grunge"" texture.  Inside the rings, the title ""Queen 399, Her Legend Lives On""

In my designs, I added  ©with my name; although I do realize that is not a legal, documented copyright, it is an implied copyright.  At the time I submitted my products to Etsy, I spent a great deal of time looking through all of the related pages, and there were no designs that looked like mine, hence my creativity.

A day or two after I submitted my listing and my product was visible on Etsy, I noticed a sticker/decal that used all of my design elements (the listing was newer than my listing - you can tell by the item number).  The double ring, the thickness of the rings, the saying, the years added, the title, the dual color silhouettes in the center.  The only thing that was changed was the font used for the title, but the font that was used was VERY similar to my work.

The only other thing they changed, is they covered my ""middle"" of the design with their own image, covering my implied copyright.  One can immediately see the similarities, and it is very, very similar to my work, and it was my idea.","This has caused me a great deal of distress.  I created my logos/designs over several days, it took a great deal of time to come up with something not seen, different, and unique from other sellers.  In addition, after approaching her, she stated verbatim:
""I want to make it clear that my design is not copied from yours.  The circle outline used in my design is distinct, and my work clearly differs from yours in both execution and originality.  I ask you to refrain from making false accusations.  If you believe otherwise, I am confident that Etsy will recognize the individuality of my work?  (see attachment)

There is nothing ""distinct"" in her circle outlines; even the thickness of the lines are the same; the same grunge pattern was applied, and in the same color. 
There is nothing to note ""difference in execution or originality"" - her idea was not original, it was copied directly from mine.  It is clear my work directly inspired her copy.  The center ""theme"" is the same; silhouette w/ 2-3 colors.

It has greatly bothered me that I am also being called a liar; it has affected my current shop sales (all of my products featuring the same cause are donated to a charity), as well as future shop sales from those 3 designs I created and registered with Etsy.

I have also lost the integrity; the way people view my work is very important to me.  If people think that I copied someone else's work in an attempt to make a profit, that makes me look and feel dishonest   I have other designs in my shop that I did not create, I do not put my name on those.  Things I CREATE and I alone are the inspiration for, mean a lot to me.

Current sale, future sales, how people view my shops honesty and integrity are at stake.  I have also spent a lot of time documenting this, creating mockups for you to view, etc.

I am seeking damages, pay for my time, and any attorney fees I may accumulate.  Although I elected to represent myself, I will be hiring an attorney and have already contacted them.

Attached are examples of my design, the same design w/ copyright and name through them; my design has my name in the center of all of the circular designs.  I took the decal she made, and made an overlay with opacity at 37% so you can see my design under her own; you can see the dates match up exactly, the circles are almost identical as with the text and text placement.  The texture in the circles is the same affect.

I also attached a photo of her work; with the 4 designs offered using my design for the bulk of her represented work.  I am seeking $5000.00 in damages due to time, distress, attorney fee/advice, and loss of sales. If this ends up going further, and costing a lot more time, documentation, loss of sales and future sales, then I will proceed with small claims"

24-CCB-0313,Parsons v. Mannion,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/10242,"""aligns with fair use principles, providing critical commentary on an issue of public interest"":  
A fictional drawing/map I, a private citizen, created in my personal and private Google Drive is NOT an issue of public interest.

""Purpose and Character of Use: The map was used for the purpose of commentary and critique, which is a transformative use"" : 
It was not transformed.  It was simply put on screen in a video without my permission, without any context, without any proof of validity or relevance to the critique he thought was offered.  In fact, the commentary and critique provided was slanderous, harmful to my reputation & a total misrepresentation of a drawing that he had no right to share on a monetized video.

""My use was non-commercial and meant to provide insight on a matter of public interest"":  
This Youtube channel is monetized, so any content published on it, by default, is commercial.  And again, my fictional drawings and creations are no matter of public interest, nor ever created for the purpose of being in the public sphere.

""Nature of the Copyrighted Work: The map is factual in nature"": 
This 'map' is not at all factual in nature.  It was created by me for me & contains visual representations of my personal interpretation of hearsay, and was never going to be published by me or anyone else for any purpose.

""Amount and Substantiality: I used only a minimal portion of the map—about three seconds—"" : 
It was, in fact, shown on screen for nearly THIRTY seconds along with the speaker stating ""this is a map that [she] had drawn.""  

""4. Effect on the Market: The use of the map in this context does not harm the market value of the original work,"":
This is a ludicrous statement to make.","The misrepresentation itself is considered harm.  Private citizens should not have to go through these processes to ""prove"" a drawing they made from their own independent thoughts, for their own personal use, are in fact their own. This YouTube creator has had many copyright claims filed on their channel & is a habitual offender.  The misrepresented counterclaim has taken up a substantial amount of my time to rectify, as well as time off of work.
But mostly, the grotesque mischaracterized ""commentary"" he claims he made about my personal work has caused extreme harm to my character and reputation. My drawing, that he had NO permission to share, was used for the purpose of ""public interest"" in the form of degradation, ridicule & encouraged brigaded harassment."

""The provided link for the ""original"" was deleted or never existed. I, however, actually have a copy of the ACTUAL ORIGINAL unlisted on my youtube. James Colwell or Falter_xv is once again abusing DMCA to silence critique.""

This is incorrect as my video was created on Youtube and is owned by me. X Corp suspended Jordan Mcfaddden's previous account of @CreateMyUnivers (https://x.com/CreateMyUnivers.) 
An account I have filed about in previous eccb reports. 
His account (CreateMyUnivers) was permanently suspended from X Corp September 30, 2024. 
Jordan Mcfadden is using an alternative account to repost removed content that he was suspended by X Corp for using on a new account. 
X Corp has previously removed the content that was reported via report filed: August 28, 2024. And, they have not re-instated this content. 
(Previous Report Number with X Corp: 0376961595 [ref:00DA0000000K0A8.500Vp00000AtgYl:ref]; filed August 28th, 2024 and removed from X Corp on August 29, 2024)

Despite evidence being provided to X Corp about previous removals of the exact same content which they have not re-instated, X Corp on October 10, 2024 has sent an email saying that they will re-instate the content to their platform due to (below.) 
[Images 2: false Youtube removal and false filing by Jordan Mcfadden]

2: Jordan Mcfadden filed a false claim at my Youtube channel and the video I own on October 4th. The same day that his content using mine that was months old that he had lost on his previously suspended account. Youtube has told me they will re-instate my video, but it was this false removal that Jordan Mcfadden used to falsely misrepresent in his counter notice that my content did not exist.

Jordan Mcfadden's alleged claim about my content not being present on the platform and X Corp's reinstatement of the content based on his wrongful filing of his counter claim is an act of misrepresentation based on X Corp acting on a re-instating of the content removed due to a wrongful and false filing of the counter notification by Jordan Mcfadden.

3: Jordan Mcfadden would go on to use X Corp to post additional threats and my content at me, even going so far as to commit a crime against me at my residence using the counter filings and DMCA proceedings as a mean to harm me and my person. A police report was filed with my San Bernardino Police (Incident Number: 2024-03004815) due to Jordan Mcfadden's threats and behaviors as he misuses the copyright system to harass, doxx, harm, threaten, and stalk people whom he does not like.

To re-iterate:

The misrepresentation occured due to X Corp not keeping previously removed content, removed from the platform. Telling me they will reinstate previously removed and suspended content when posted on a new account by Jordan Mcfadden, and acting on a Counter Claim filing by Jordan Mcfadden which was filed by him in bad faith after sending a false DMCA claim at my own Youtube content so as to provide a false statement to X Corp in an attempt to abuse their copyright systems.

4: Additionally, Jordan Mcfadden uses eCCB court proceedings and filings in a manner to harass those in a public manner on his social media pages despite being suspended for previous behaviors:

https://x.com/WorldwalkerUni/status/1842241003299749944

He will link himself to these court proceedings after harassing people with the false claims, misrepresenting in counter claims to get Twitter to restore content in a wrongful way, and then use these and other DMCA filings to harass and target rather than in the proper and legal ways they should be used.","The harm resulting from the alleged misrepresentation includes reputational damage, loss of control over my intellectual property, and potential financial losses due to the unauthorized use of my work. Jordan Mcfadden's false claims undermine the integrity of my content and mislead the audience, which can lead to a decrease in my own viewership and, consequently, revenue.

I am seeking $5,000 in damages as compensation for the harm suffered due to these actions. This amount is intended to cover the financial losses incurred and to deter future misrepresentations and infringement of my intellectual property rights. 
I am also seeking compensation to cover the mental abuse and physical abuse I have sustained at the hands of Jordan Mcfadden as a result of his actions, threats, and behaviors due to his misrepresentation.

3. ""The claimant has incorrectly identified my work as theirs.""
4. ""I have not used any unauthorized content from the claimant.""



Kimberly Smith's statements are factually incorrect and intentionally misleading. In her live stream, she explicitly admitted that the content she was about to play, which included my copyrighted music, *Dani Montana (Instrumental)*, and my voice, was not her own. Despite this, she falsely claimed in the counter-notification that she is the creator and owner of the song. These statements misrepresent the true ownership of the work and were made with the intent to falsely assert her rights to circumvent the legitimate takedown of her video.

Her claim that I have incorrectly identified my work as hers is another falsehood, as it is registered under my name with the U.S. Copyright Office. Additionally, her statement that she has ""not used any unauthorized content"" from me is blatantly untrue, as she used my music and voice without permission, which constitutes unauthorized use under copyright law.

This misrepresentation seeks to avoid the consequences of her infringement by fraudulently claiming ownership over content that she neither created nor owns.","Kimberly Smith’s unauthorized use of my copyrighted music, Dani Montana (Instrumental), and her false claims of ownership have caused significant harm both financially and to my reputation as a creator. By falsely claiming to own my registered work, she has been able to monetize my content on YouTube without my permission or any proper transformation under fair use. This has resulted in financial loss as she profits from my work, while I, the rightful copyright holder, am denied the revenue generated by her use of my content.

In addition to financial harm, her actions undermine my standing as the creator and owner of my copyrighted music. The fraudulent counter-notification submitted by Kimberly Smith circumvents the legitimate takedown processes intended to protect creators like me. This not only delays the rightful removal of infringing content but also sets a dangerous precedent where my intellectual property rights are openly challenged and devalued by false claims.

By continuing to claim my work as her own, Kimberly Smith is damaging my reputation within the creative community, diminishing my ability to control and protect my original content. Her actions also mislead her audience into believing that my work is hers, eroding the trust I have built with my own audience and potential collaborators. This deception causes ongoing harm to my brand and future opportunities.

Relief Sought:

I am seeking the following relief:

Monetary Compensation: Compensation in the amount of $1,500 for the financial loss incurred from Kimberly Smith’s unauthorized monetization of my work, including any revenue generated from YouTube based on the infringing content.

Penalties for Fraudulent Misrepresentation: I request that appropriate penalties be imposed on Kimberly Smith for submitting a fraudulent counter-notification under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), which prohibits knowingly making material misrepresentations in a DMCA process."
24-CCB-0274,Frazier v. Fierstien,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/9753,"In his takedown notice, Mr. Fierstien wrote, ""This item was designed by me back in 2013 for the Obama campaign."" In fact, what he should have said is that in 2013 he copied my design, and apparently, has been using slight variations of my design ever since. In the counter notice, Mr. Fierstien claimed that I had identified his ""For the People"" design as infringing by mistake. Most likely he knew all along that there was no mistake and that he had finally been caught for his infringement.","As described above (in the section on infringement), I believe Mr. Fierstien's infringing products may have cost me thousands of dollars over the years. I do not know how much I lost, partly because I do not have a list of all the infringing product designs he sold, or how many of each design he sold. Mr. Fierstien's false counter notice to Etsy claiming that I made a mistake in identifying his ""For the People"" design as infringing, and his subsequent false report to Etsy that my ""The Choice of Educated People"" design was infringing on his ""For the People"" design should be factored into deciding the proper amount of relief. I ask the CCB to award me $5000 in relief for Mr. Fierstien's long-term, willful, ongoing and egregious conduct. Furthermore, I ask that Mr. Fierstien be ordered to cease offering his infringing ""For the People"" design on bumper stickers, bumper magnets, or any other products. He should also be ordered not to offer any other designs that substantively infringe on my ""Choice of Educated People"" design or any of my other similar designs. I would also like a declaration of non-infringement because the evidence clearly shows that my designs were the original designs pre-dating Fierstien's infringing designs by several years."
24-CCB-0271,"Jarman v. Hey Ricochet, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/9644,"In this case, it's my opinion that both Shopify and Hey Ricochet had misrepresentations of my claim.
Shopify never removed the infringing content after I sent the DMCA takedown notice.
On 9/4/2024 they responded via email, stating:

I responded:
""Below are the links with explanation of the infringing work:

I've also attached a side-by-side comparison named TitaniaHeyRicochetSideBySide showing the substantial similarity between my Titania fairy wings design and theirs, with only a couple veins removed. 
This specific wing design does not occur in nature, and furthermore, I've also made hair accessories and hair combs with my wing designs on them and planned to use this Titania Fairy Wings design this year. The use of such a substantially similar design by HeyRicochet harms my market to sell my own fairy wing hair combs.

I responded that I've provided all the evidence necessary and that they lose their Safe Harbor protections if the listing is not removed.

Then, today on 9/9/2024 they responded that a counter notice was filed:
""We have received a counter notice in response to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice you submitted on 2024-09-01 23:04:50 UTC about heyricochet.com. 

In accordance with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the removed content listed in the counter notice may be reposted, within 10-14 business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless Shopify receives notice that you have filed a legal action seeking a court order to restrain the merchant from engaging in infringing activity.

However, the content was never removed in the first place, so I'm not sure why a counter notice was filed.
I believe the infringing content is easily identified, and I provided all the necessary information, links, screenshots and a copy of my copyright certificate.
The counter notice states ""I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the affected content was removed as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the content to be removed.""
However I don't believe there was any mistake or misidentification. 
I think it's clear that their product is substantially similar to my Titania Fairy Wings and therefore infringing.","I've sent a Cease & Desist letter to Hey Ricochet on 8/26/2024, asking for the content to be removed within 28 hours, and hoped the issue could be settled privately and without the need to file a legal claim.

I've had no further response since beyond the counter notice, and the infringing item still has an active listing. As I stated earlier in this claim, the sales of the infringing fairy wing hair combs competes with my market and harms my ability to sell my own hair combs using my Titania Fairy Wings design. The price point is very low as the infringing work has been mass produced in China, which I believe is unfair competition when the design is a derivative of my own and I have not been paid a license fee or royalties.
I will wait until discovery to determine the damages I'm seeking."
24-CCB-0259,cetani v. armstrong,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/9525,"I filmed this video out on the baseball fields. I own all rights to this video that has been posted on YouTube. This is a mistake and I did nothing wrong

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which YouTube is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant.","I've had to spend hours registering the video and  filing claims to get the video removed which has taken away time from my design and jewelry business that I run in my spare time outside of my 40+ hour a week job.  I believe the video is being monetized off my sons likeness on their you tube because of the millions of views it has received. Alex Armstong did not dispute the 2 time removal of the video due to copyright infringement on Instagram because Instagram has limited monetization depending on when you signed up but you tube does allow monetizing and they pay very well.  My son is getting absolutely destroyed, mocked and made fun of on their you tube page and I have no control over the comments and being able to remove them for his mental health. They claim my son was sent to the hospital as a result of the injury which is completely false. I have not been able to shop this video around to others in order to monetize it because I have had to deal with this infringement."
24-CCB-0257,Colwell v. Mcfadden,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/9413,"Misrepresentation in Counter Claim: Jordan Mcfadden, (@CreateMyUnivers,) misrepresents his counter claim in the following wording: ""This is a video I editted which I still have the raw file to on my main computer. It is part of a longer, upcoming video I am working on. Also, the supposed ""source"" was posted AFTER my post on X (Formerly known as Twitter.) This must be an accidental DMCA or a mistake.""

This is misrepresentative as Jordan Mcfadden incorrectly assumes and states that the DMCA takedown was issued as a mistake under the misconception that the video in my takedown is part of an ongoing video edit he has not published on a different website. It is in fact a video I own that I have used as ongoing documentation to help prove my innocence in an ongoing defamation case against a different party that Jordan Mcfadden has attempted to harass me for. Jordan Mcfadden posted this video intentionally knowing what he was doing on the X (formerly Twitter,) platform with the intention of misleading the audience with content that exposes him.

Jordan Mcfadden goes on to assert the following: ""You can also see the date and time the video was published (one hour or so after mine) using metadata tracking. My video was published earlier, I still have the original file, and this is a flat reupload on another site."" Which is incorrect as video meta data in my Youtube studio can corroborate the upload time of the video itself as being a day before Jordan Mcfadden made his tweet and posted my video.

Jordan Mcfadden asserts that he believes my DMCA filing was a mistake. It is not.","The harm resulting from the alleged misrepresentation includes reputational damage, loss of control over my intellectual property, and potential financial losses due to the unauthorized use of my work. Jordan Mcfadden's false claims undermine the integrity of my content and mislead the audience, which can lead to a decrease in my own viewership and, consequently, revenue.

I am seeking $5,000 in damages as compensation for the harm suffered due to these actions. This amount is intended to cover the financial losses incurred and to deter future misrepresentations and infringement of my intellectual property rights.

24-CCB-0256,Andrews v. Pariss,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/9410,"Wyomme Pariss knowingly made a false claim of copyright infringement against the film title, Then Sings My Soul, by claiming to be the ""Rights Claimant"" of the film.  Wyomme Pariss acted in a retaliatory action for the judgment that I, Jasmine Deanne Andrews, was granted against her.  Sullied Bride Productions via Jasmine Deanne Andrews holds the copyright for the film, Then Sings My Soul, © 2022 Registration Pau 4-169-263.  This copyright registration was presented to Wyomme Pariss in court and was sent to the lawyer she had retained before court proceedings when a judgment was entered against her for breach of contract.  The contract which Wyomme Pariss breached clearly indicates that Sullied Bride Productions retained the rights to produce the motion picture based on the screenplay adaptation of Then Sings My Soul and retain ownership of the film as intellectual property.  The copyright for the film, Then Sings My Soul, © 2022 Registration Pau 4-169-263 reflects Jasmine Deanne Andrews/Sullied Bride Productions as the copyright holder and owner of the intellectual property. 
The copyright held by Wyomme Pariss is for the screenplay adaptation for Then Sings My Soul, © 2022 Registration Pau 4-120-937 which was a work for hire.  The terms for this work for hire specified in the Writer’s Agreement, that Sullied Bride Productions was authorized by the First Right of Refusal to produce the film based on the screenplay adaptation where Sullied Bride Productions retains ownership of the film as intellectual property.  Wyomme Pariss breached the terms of the Movie Production Contract resulting in a judgment against her in the amount of $25,000.  Then, after breaching the contract Wyomme Pariss furthermore continued a misrepresentation of ownership by knowingly making a false claim of copyright infringement over the film, Then Sings My Soul.","As a result of Wyomme Pariss knowingly making a false claim of copyright infringement, by claiming herself as the ""Rights Claimant"" I have suffered damages in the loss of income over my copyrighted work, the film Then Sings My Soul.  Because Wyomme Pariss misrepresented her claim on the film Then Sings My Soul, Filmhub removed all active licenses for the title and issued takedown notices at the channels causing me financial losses for the time the film has been unavailable for streaming, and DVD sales for distribution.  I have also suffered losses in marketing expenses that were incurred promoting a film that became unavailable for distribution.  Therefore, I am seeking relief in the amount of $30,000."

Heather Firca D/B/A MilMie Designs",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/9038,"Heather Firca and Johnny Threads Inc. both had similar text based graphic tees listed online for a ""Shake Shake Shake Senora"" design. Despite not owning a copyright for the design as described in 313.4(c), Heather Firca filed a DMCA takedown with Etsy on June 23, 2024 claiming ownership. The listing was removed from Etsy and as of this filing, remains down. After communication between Johnny Threads and Heather Firca's attorney, Heather Firca has admitted she did not have authority to file a DMCA takedown.","Heather Firca expeditiously eliminated a direct competitor by fraudulently claiming ownership of a design she did not have copyright protection on. Our listing has remained down for over a month while Heather Firca cashes in on sales from her listing. This particular listing is a Halloween design and we have lost all momentum from having our listing down during this critical pre-fall period. The way many Etsy sales are gained are when buyers ""favorite"" an item and then come back to it when ready to purchase. Additionally, generating views and ""favorites"" pushes listings  higher in terms of customer visibility and is crucial to gaining sales. None of this has happened for our listing as it was taken down by Etsy after the DMCA takedown. Furthermore, we've seen an overall reduction in both sales and views on Etsy since the DMCA notice was filed, due to a copyright strike which is now attached to our account and has throttled our Etsy listings. We also stopped listing products for several weeks as we were concerned about more fraudulent DMCA takedowns and the possibility that Etsy would terminate our account."

The take down notice and removal of this item was not a mistake or a misidentification. Despite the alterations made to the underlying image, the derivative work still constitutes a clear and substantial copy of the original copyrighted work. The changes are superficial and do not transform the original image in such a way that it loses its distinct and recognizable characteristics. As such, this constitutes a violation of my exclusive rights under copyright law, and the respondent has lied by issuing this counter notice.","The respondent has been selling this item at a substantially lower price point, while the item looks almost identical to mine, leading to a loss of sales. After reviewing customer reviews in their shop, it is apparent the respondent has sold many copies of my work. Last year, this single design accounted for 25% of all of my sales.

the copyright holder for purposes such as criticism, commentary,
news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
The misrepresentation is further evidenced when she falsely stated
that the work does not belong to me, despite knowing the contrary.
This is shown by her actions of tagging me and incorporating my
name into the video titles to attract views based on my work. By
claiming ownership over my intellectual property, Sybrena not only
inaccurately represents the nature of her rights to use the content but
also deliberately attempts to mislead others regarding the true owner
of the content, which constitutes a clear case of misrepresentation.","Due to Sybrena Evans's unauthorized use of my intellectual property and her subsequent misrepresentation, I have endured substantial harm. Evans wrongfully asserted ownership over my work, ""Dani Montana (Instrumental),"" in a counter-notice to YouTube on February 26, 2024, and February 27, 2024. Her false claims have significantly undermined my copyright, leading to a dilution in the market value of my work and complicating its copyright enforcement.

To whom this may concern, While preparing for the upcoming amendment I discovered some discrepancies which apparently may fall under misrepresentation. I took a long time to come to this conclusion by giving the respondents the benefit of the doubt. However, after evaluation I discovered some blatantly false statements the respondents knowingly made to avoid removal of their infringing content in several counter-notifications by the respondents that may very well have been the deciding factor on whether the OSP would grant the counter notification which did indeed inevitably result in the reinstatement of the content or at the very least the removal of the strike imposed on the respondents channels. This decision was not based on “errors or mistakes” but pure misinformation by the respondents. The statements listed below are taken from various counter notifications from Kenneth Rucker and Damon Lovell.

Before we move forward let's make it clear they are online right now claiming to be ""copyright experts"" and that the Plaintiff is a Liar. So, if they use the excuse, ""I didn't know"" it should be looked upon with scrutiny. 

Additionally this is a disclaimer YouTube states in their Platform.
 
""YouTube videos are copyrighted to the person who created and then uploaded them onto YouTube. You can link to another person's YouTube video, but you should never re-upload it or claim it is your own"". 

Below is a list of some of the misrepresentations detected by the Plaintiff

1/1/24 LOVELL “The CCB is not a legal proceeding” 

The CCB is a Legal Proceeding and This is my response which is a statement taken directly from the CCB website, ""On June 16, 2022, the U.S. Copyright Office launched its new copyright small claims tribunal called the Copyright Claims Board (CCB). The CCB is a three member tribunal with extensive expertise in copyright matters that is a voluntary, affordable, and streamlined alternative to federal court for certain small copyright claims."" In other words, it's a ""Legal Proceeding"" so much so that the Defendant himself submitted a case with the CCB. This is conclusive evidence that he researched and  knew the CCB,  which is also mentioned on YouTube as an option,  was a Legal Proceeding but he used this statement as his primary argument in several counter-notifications. 
. 
RUCKER 11/15/23 “James Dillard has no copyright protection on his channel which includes images, soundbites and screenshots."" - YouTube videos are copyrighted to the person who created and then uploaded them onto YouTube so for Rucker to make that statement to such a rudimentary fact clearly is grounds for misrepresentation.   

7/31/23 RUCKER ""The video in review contains content that is NOT owned by James Dillard. I have edited this content so much so, I Believe it is my original content.""

 It's a basic copyright fact that you cannot own someone else copyrighted content who did not give you permission. YouTube videos are copyrighted to the person who created and then uploaded them onto YouTube."" There's nothing truthful about this statement at all. The copyrighted content he was referring to in his counter-notification was a copyrighted unpublished private selfie he and his fellow Defendants doxed and repeatedly uploaded multiple times.


 7/31/23 J4WD7KOQHSKCW54G6AYIDUJBSY RUCKER   ""The video in review contains content that is NOT owned by James Dillard. I have edited this content so much so, I Believe it is my original content.

Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work. If the use is transformative it is more likely to be fair use. The original content creator did NOT state that he did not state the work is copyrighted. The copyright strike is another false attempt from James Dillard and it's a mistake.” He’s literally using a doxed image of James Dillard that he knows is James Dillard and its’ a selfie of James Dillard but he’s stating the Claimant doesn’t own said selfie.  Shirtoffjames is clearly in the ownership of James Dillard and there’s a certificate attached to prove it. 

11/15/23 RUCKER  “James Dillard has no copyright protection on his channel which includes images, soundbites and screenshots. Copyrights are established at conception and again Youtube states the uploader owns rights to the content and It’s very interesting Rucker's choice of words as the items infringed upon happen to be “images, soundbites and screenshots”.  

12/9/23 LOVELL “Then he uses a fraudulent pretend legal document to hold up the copyright until pending litigation which never happens.” False the CCB Document is not “pretend ”and the case is “happening”. 
 
1/17/24 “CCB is NOT a legal proceeding. It is just a form.” Damon Lovell obviously knew his statement is false additionally if this wasn't a legal proceeding as he stated in his counter-notification why is he submitting a case via the CCB? It's clear he knew and knows this is a legal proceeding by his language and actions. Damon Lovell has released several videos bragging about suing via the CCB the complainant/plaintiff and the only way you can do that is through a legal proceeding.

11/18/23  5HIVD3IWYTP2KTYN5BCQMJLAXQ @djtorchlive has a history of filing frivolous and inaccurate legal suits to hold up the copyright strike but never serves the complaint while at the same time continuing to strike content creators channels hiding behind the fake legal suit claiming to have copyright protection. He is referring to the CCB as a ""fake legal suit"" and If it was a ""fake legal lawsuit"" he would not be a litigant at the moment.

""The copyright system is not there to silence critics, it's there to protect your original work which is not what The YouTube Underground is doing because most of her channel is doing what I do, reacting to other people.

24-CCB-0139,Lovell v. Dillard,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/8196,James  H Dillard claimed to have a registered copyright.  He lied to YouTube on there legal document claiming to have a valid copyright.  He never had such thing.  He used the document to takedown channel that he wanted off YouTube platform.  He misused their policy and the DMCA to shut his critics and rivals up.,"The damages occurred is lost revenue for 6 YouTube channels bringing in 2,000 a month. Other damages is time lost filing reports and counter claims.  James H. Dillard filed over 100 copyright takedown claims. I represented 3 due to obviously violation of DMCA.  What he was allowed to do is criminal.  Furthermore, he failed frivolous CCB suits against several individuals, 23-CCB-0266 is one. James H Dillard is a bad actor and a repeated violator of the DMCA.   I also suffer emotional stress from the constant harassing of these takedown notices.   I am asking for the maximum in damages the court allows, $5000 or more.  I would rather see him go to prison instead the monetary award.  He uses legal forums that settles disputes as a weapon to bully and harass individuals.  This should not be allowed.  James H Dillard has used the federal courts to file frivolous lawsuits claiming to have copyright rights."

Our item is handmade by us and is clearly embossed on the main body with our unique Southpaw Bear Paw artwork which is filed with the United States Copyright Office. The main body of our item is a unique sculptural 3D model that is also filed with the United States Copyright Office. All of our online Etsy shop listing photos for this item, the instructions, and care sheets that we ship with all sales of our item are all clearly marked with our artwork and a copyright mark containing a statement of All Rights Reserved.  Furthermore, Richard Mosseri is using TikTok and Facebook platforms to nefariously mislead his followers into purchasing our item from his own Etsy storefront of BeaniesPlusMoreCo at a profit to him under the guise of charity. Upon discovery of Richard Mosseri’s fraudulent actions, we refused all sales of our intellectual property to Richard Mosseri and informed him through Etsy’s messaging system that we are not a wholesaler of goods and that our item was designed with the intent to help others having difficulties using their addi Knitting Machines and not for someone else to claim as their own product and to profit from our intellectual property. Due to Richard Mosseri’s continuing harmful actions we were forced to raise the price of our item above what he was reselling it for on his storefront BeaniesPlusMoreCo to discourage his continuing attempts to deplete our inventory through straw buyers for his resale on TikTok and Etsy. This action has greatly impacted our sales to the community in which we designed this item for, thus making it unaffordable for some to obtain. This was not the intent with our creation. Richard Mosseri has also posted blatantly false, purposely deceiving, and very misleading statements as negative feedback to our Etsy storefront causing harm to our store while deceptively maintaining his continuous use and promotion of our Intellectual property as his own on TikTok and in his Etsy store. 

As for relief, we are seeking Richard Mosseri to immediately cease and desist all sales of our intellectual property through all venues and platforms. Immediately cease and desist all requests at trying to obtain our item through his own or 3rd party avenues. Immediately remove his fraudulent Copyright Counter Notice filed with Etsy along with immediate removal of all of his fraudulent feedback posted to our Etsy storefront. Immediately cease and desist all false statements and ownership claims on Etsy, TikTok, Facebook and all other social media platforms. We are also requesting monetary compensation for copyright infringement, business interruption, loss of sales, defamation and false claims that would be deemed fair and reasonable."
24-CCB-0130,Colwell v. Mcfadden,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/8119,"Jordan Mcfadden alleges the following in his counter notice which constitutes misrepresentation:

1: Jordan states: ""The information is not private as it was posted publicly on their account here: https://twitter.com/falter_xv/status/1780148793914347982/photo/2"" 

This is mirespresenting as the artwork and image for which I posted in my tweet is from a private google account that Jordan Mcfadden does not have access to. The artwork demonstrates my ownership of my account and the contents in my google drive.

2: Jordan states: ""The images there also do not belong to them, nor is the google drive copyrighted.
 Many of the images/branding seen in said image actually belong to
 @CreateMyUnivers on twitter, Flip_Light on Youtube and CreateMyUniverse on
 twitch."" 

This misrepresents as the image is of my own google drive, and my contents therein as well as the artwork. Jordan goes on to falsely allege that the image of my own drive is his artwork in his counter notice despite the fact that I am filing to protect my google drive and my account and ownership of material is clearly displayed in the image and drive as being from 2022.

 3: Jordan alleges:  Examples of said branding:
 https://x.com/CreateMyUnivers/status/1619990454979952642 Image shown on
 the google drive in the top left, owned by me and not by the claimant.
 Character, artwork and background owned by Flip_Light (My youtube channel)
 which you can find being used there and across the CreateMyUniverse Twitch
 channel:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQqrqVWMHwk&t=67s
 https://www.twitch.tv/createmyuniverse
 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzITZM2MkiWejIyNbIfvUJw""

That the google drive I own and have owned for over 2 years show videos that are less than a year old. This is a misrepresentation as the contents of the google drive are from April, March, and May of 2022 and the contents therein are owned by myself as well. They are recordings of content from Twitch.tv not Youtube. Jordan Mcfadden misidenties the content he is filing about as he wrongly lists the contents contained therein.

4:  Jordan alleges: ""Various videos which can be found on the CreateMyUniverse YT channel (Private
 and unlisted) which can be provided upon further request (Channel located here.):
 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4F-hyd5W-qNCaagYP6qZxw
 Artwork from the music video ""Carousel of discord"" owned by one of my channels
 also located here and found on my twitter CreateMyUnivers here:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tW4jM8Vtsjo""

This is the same as the previous point as Jordan Mcfadden is misrepresenting the image of my own google drive which show content I have owned prior to the creation of the video Mcfadden is trying to claim give him the right to file a counter notification against my content. If Jordan Mcfadden truly owned the content present and wished to debate it, he would have filed a DMCA against said private content over 2 years ago in 2022. He has not and is instead filing a counter notification against me requesting him to not post my content. He continues to post wrong information in his counter notification as he is clearly misrepresenting the filing which was over an image, not over videos.

5: Jordan Mcfadden alleges: "" James also has a history of abusing DMCA in an attempt to silence others. I
 believe this is simply DMCA abuse seeking to silence those criticizing him. He does not own the copyright to the google drive seen in the image, he does not own the copyright to the content shown. He posted a screenshot publicly and shared it on his account. My post was also designed to criticize him for taking my content and holding it in a drive. I believe this content is not owned by the claimant and my post falls perfectly under fair use. I also own the majority of the images shown there and have the channels/urls/proof to back it up.
 I highly encourage the reinstating of this image.""

This statement is incorrect and is not relevant to the counter notification and is more in line with continued slander and abuse Jordan Mcfadden has done to my account and person in reference to police report dated: (San Bernardino Police) against Jordan Mcfadden registered report: 2022-03001852. As Jordan Mcfadden has been under an ongoing restraining order and multiple reports against his person for an ongoing harassment, theft, abuse, and doxxing campaign he has done to myself. He has been known to have posted false information about this to contiinue to make acts of defamation to target me, rather than properly speak about events present. His statement in and of itself is a misrepresentation and lie as it does not speak truthly about the circumstances of his current unlawful acts against me, my social media accounts, and person. And, CreateMyUnivers (/ his Twitch handle of CreateMyUniverse,) was suspended from both X corp and Twitch.com in 2022 for these exact behaviors for over a week.","The harm resulting from the alleged misrepresentation includes reputational damage, loss of control over my intellectual property, and potential financial losses due to the unauthorized use of my work. Jordan Mcfadden's false claims undermine the integrity of my content and mislead the audience, which can lead to a decrease in my own viewership and, consequently, revenue.

The relief I am seeking includes the removal and permanent restriction of the specified tweets from X Corp to prevent further unauthorized use and dissemination of my content. As well as a restriction and restrain against Jordan Mcfadden / @CreateMyUnivers on all forms of X Corp including but not limited to alternate accounts, and any secondary accounts or ""friends"" he could use to continue to act indirectly. I am also seeking a full legal protective order against Jordan Mcfaddden. Additionally, I am seeking $5,000 in damages as compensation for the harm suffered due to these actions. This amount is intended to cover the financial losses incurred and to deter future misrepresentations and infringement of my intellectual property rights.

US Copyright Registration #TX0009381788
Wednesday: Child of Woe, literary work and art likeness
Nature of Complaint: “Wednesday” is mislabeled causing the general public to be misled. MGM
is required by law to use its registered copyright title “Wednesday Addams” not Wednesday.”
In addition likenesses of “Wednesday Addams” in the TV series should be as close to the
original Charles Addams Cartoon as possible such as she appears in the 1960’s TV, and the
Addams Family movies and animation which is that of a 9yo. Large departures from this causes
confusion and is misleading to the public.
Case in point my IP Wednesday: Child of Woe character is a Young Adult, with main
protagonists which are werewolves and vampires and uses high fantasy magic and magical
realism.
Charles Addams’s cartoon and the Addams Family movie, animation and TV series share
NONE of these characteristics or likenesses. Making them distinct easily distinguished IPs
“Wednesday” properly titled “Wednesday Addams” contains all of the characteristics, likeness
and lore of Wednesday: Child of Woe making it deliberately misleading and a passing off of my
IP as it is in no way similar to any of Charles Addams Addams Family universe work or
characters.
Any reasonable person examining these two IPs would say “Wednesday” is confusingly labeled
and far closer related to Wednesday: Child of Woe than it is to Addams Family.
As such I request the IP infringing products and pre-release be immediately removed from your
site.","Amazon account deleted, loss of sales, loss of paid advertising monies, loss of literary agent offers, loss of reputation.
I am seeking: 
1. Immediate renaming of ""Wednesday"" products as they are legally registered as ""Wednesday Addams"".
2. Destruction of all misleading ""Wednesday"" labeled property.
3. Reimbursement for lost sales.
4. Reimbursement for lost advertising.
5. Cease production of knock off ""Wednesday"" series literary work by Penguin publishing.
6. MGM return to the original likeness for ""Wednesday Addams"" in age, demeanor and clothing matching the Charles Addams cartoon character as have been done with the IP in every live action and animated representation of her since the 1960s.
7. Remain consistent with the Addams Family world lore, which does not contain vampire, werewolves, high fantasy or magical realism.  in order to maintain a recognizable distinction between ""Wednesday Addams"", ""Addams Family"" and ""Wednesday: Child of Woe"" IPs.
8. In alternative to  #6 #7 enter good faith negotiations with Francesco Santora for his IP and character likeness and world which the ""Wednesday"" series is far closer to than the ""Addams Family"" IP."

24-CCB-0108,Brown v. Plant,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/7798,"Facebook user Emmett Plant asserted that his infringing content ""was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.""  To the contrary, the infringing content was properly removed or disabled by Facebook.  Further, user Emmett Plant falsely asserted that he had the right to reproduce my copyrighted photograph because ""It was a news story, and all of the information presented in it was both true and verified."" In addition, he also falsely asserted that he had the right to reproduce my copyrighted photograph because I ""would be considered a public figure."" Facebook user Emmett Plant knew these statements to be untrue because, according to his own representations, he has written extensively about the DMCA and even helped write a book on the DMCA.  So Emmett Plant knew that his claims were false, yet he set them forth in a counter-notification that he sent to Facebook in an attempt to have the infringing content restored.","Facebook user Emmett Plant reposted his false counter-notification verbatim on his Facebook page as a separate post to try to intimate wrongdoing on my behalf, rather than his.  Not only did this publicly available post repeat his earlier falsehoods from the counter-notification, but he also implied that I was in the wrong for protecting my copyright.  In responses to the Facebook post, users implied that I, rather than Emmett Plant, had engaged in abuse of the DMCA takedown and counter-notification process, and Emmett Plant agreed with them.  I seek reimbursement of the costs of registering my copyright, reimbursement of my costs and expenses for filing this action, statutory damages as the CCB determines reasonable, and an order directing Facebook user Emmett Plant to refrain from reproducing my copyrighted materials in any way without my permission, or otherwise infringing on my copyright."
24-CCB-0105,Colwell v. Ahring,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/7774,"Brandon Ahring, (@NoObStEr9919) assertations were conflicting in the multiple postings of my content. Brandon Ahring invoked fair use in the following wording: ""A video I had posted to the attached tweet was removed due to copyright concerns by the user @falter_xv. This user claims that I stole their content, as the email containing their DMCA notice states ""It is a copy of my Armored Core 6 Youtube video posted without my permission."" The provided YouTube link to where the video I had attached to my tweet was allegedly stolen from does not contain the material I uploaded. The link to the original work provided in the email can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXjO2MX-Hso"""" 

This statement is incorrect as the tweet which Brandon Ahring refers to in his counter notification asserts that the video for which I filed a removal was was not properly identified despite naming me the owner of the content and the subject of the content in his afformentioned tweet on his (@NoObStEr9919) X profile, in addition to other locations where he also posted the same content that he admitted was me such as a google doc as his head tweet, and a second account under the name of: (@Ri_Koshka). Additionally, Brandon Ahring asserts his use of my content but fails to mention that per X's rules as well as Twitch and YT's rules that a blocked account is unable to view my tweets or content. By Brandon Ahring showing he was able to view my tweets, content, media, and uploads he has provided a false claim on his counter notification.

Additionally Brandon Ahring asserts the rights to this content and that it was misidentified but fails to state the said content was removed on another account on a tweet made on Xcorp in the exact same way that Brandon Ahring also made said tweet: https://twitter.com/Ri_Koshka/status/1772809199438962825

This shows that Brandon Ahring is lying about his ownership of said content and is acting in bad faith by intentionally misusing the counter claim system by falsely filing information by attempting to withhold important legal information about previous removals of said content.","The harm resulting from the alleged misrepresentation includes reputational damage, loss of control over my intellectual property, and potential financial losses due to the unauthorized use of my work. Brandon Ahring's false claims undermine the integrity of my content and mislead the audience, which can lead to a decrease in my own viewership and, consequently, revenue.

The relief I am seeking includes the removal and permanent restriction of the specified videos from Xcorp and Google Docs to prevent further unauthorized use and dissemination of my content. Additionally, I am seeking $5,000 in damages as compensation for the harm suffered due to these actions. This amount is intended to cover the financial losses incurred and to deter future misrepresentations and infringement of my intellectual property rights.

She does not claim fair use instead she makes use of her counter notice to insult me and redirect Twitch to a twitter link rather than any evidence that I wrongly identified the content of mine in her video present.

She does not contest my DMCA claim(s), rather she uses the counter filing system to attempt to insult me. She is wrongfully filing her counter notification as Twitch requires Elara Bowman to specify why she believes my filing was incorrect and to show forms of fair use. She does not do either of these.","The harm resulting from the alleged misrepresentation includes reputational damage, loss of control over my intellectual property, and potential financial losses due to the unauthorized use of my work.

Evans Kenan,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/7292,"The misrepresentation in Sybrena's counter-notification statements can be identified in the words where she ""claimed that she owned my intellectual property."" This assertion directly conflicts with her previous claim of using the audio under fair use, a principle that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright holder for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. 

The misrepresentation is further evidenced when she falsely stated that the work does not belong to me, despite knowing the contrary. This is shown by her actions of tagging me and incorporating my name into the video titles to attract views based on my work. By claiming ownership over my intellectual property, Sybrena not only inaccurately represents the nature of her rights to use the content but also deliberately attempts to mislead others regarding the true owner of the content, which constitutes a clear case of misrepresentation.","The harm resulting from the alleged misrepresentation includes reputational damage, loss of control over my intellectual property, and potential financial losses due to the unauthorized use of my work.

In this particular case there was no transformative work done to the original video, he did not use a small insignificant portion of the video but rather the entire video without alteration, because he reused the video and posted it on his own page it has negatively impacted the market value of the original work and it does not serve a different purpose of the original video. In the re-uploaded video of the original work there is no criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

The unauthorized posting of a video containing my copyrighted material without my consent has resulted in a profound invasion of my privacy. This violation has led to a cascade of detrimental effects, including:

Emotional Trauma: I have experienced intense feelings of fear, anxiety, and vulnerability, which have been persistent and debilitating. The constant worry about further exposure and harassment has severely impacted my daily life.

Privacy Violation: The non-consensual use and dissemination of my video have left me feeling exposed and powerless. This invasion of my personal space and rights has been a source of ongoing distress.

Reputational Harm: The widespread availability of this video online has damaged my reputation, both personally and professionally. This has led to embarrassment and potential long-term consequences for my career and social relationships.

Psychological Stress: The situation has significantly strained my mental health, necessitating the need for professional counseling. I have had to invest time and resources in seeking therapeutic support to cope with the trauma.

Social and Relationship Impact: This incident has caused me to withdraw from social interactions and has placed a strain on my relationships with family, friends, and colleagues.

Relief Sought:

In light of the above-mentioned harm, I am seeking the following relief:

Small Claims Compensation: I am pursuing compensation through a small claims process for the emotional, psychological, and reputational damages I have suffered. This compensation is sought to cover the costs associated with counseling, legal fees, and the broader impact on my life.

Take Down of Infringing Videos: I am requesting the immediate removal of the unauthorized video(s) from all platforms where they have been posted. This step is crucial in mitigating further harm and restoring my sense of privacy and control.

This relief is essential not only for my personal recovery but also to set a precedent that such violations of privacy and copyright are unacceptable and have serious consequences. I trust that the small claims process will recognize the severity of the harm inflicted upon me and grant the appropriate relief as a means of justice and restoration."
23-CCB-0408,"Rucker v. Dillard, et al",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6317,"The respondent,James Dillard, made a misrepresentation in all of his takedown notices and his counter-notices. The following are the words that made up the misrepresentation, YouTube asked the following questions to James Dillard and he gave them these answers: 

""How much of your copyrighted work is used? 2 Hours and 18 Minutes

How is the market for your original work affected by this use? It Diminishes the value of the original work since there is more than one copy in the same market. It reduces the effectiveness of future engagements with my subscribers by making them less interested in viewing the immediate release or live performance.

Does this use significantly transform your original work, or does it serve the same purpose? Same purpose, commentary as the original. They did not change the meaning in any way.

Does this use fall into an exception to copyright protection? No. Fair use does not cover this since the topic is the same.
They are using this only to defame my channel and reduce the effectiveness of the original content.""

In all of his takedown notices he puts in the following legal language:

Country where copyright applies: US
I state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:
I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
This notification is accurate.
I acknowledge that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages.
I understand that abuse of this tool will result in termination of my YouTube channel.
Authorized Signature: James Dillard","James Dillard used several different cyberbullying strategies in order to get all of my channels deleted from the YouTube platform. At first he used privacy notices and that didn't work. Then he misrepresented the copyright takedown notices and combined with filing a copyright claims board, docket#: 23-CCB-0266, he was able to have all my channels removed due to youtube receiving legal documentation from him. On top of that he filled 2 federal cases against me and the other content creators but we were never served as an attempt to get a default judgement against us. Because of his activities I was no longer able to earn revenue from YouTube. James Dillard is not only targeting me when it comes to the misrepresentation, he has targeted other content creators that have been critical with his content as well. He used the same abuse of copyright take down notices even though we have all won our own counter notifications against him but he keeps doing it. 

Due to his misrepresentation DMCA claims, I have been harmed for months. The relief I'm seeking would be the following:

1)A cease and desist from James Dillard. That means no more privacy notices, no more false claims for infringement through the copyright claims board, from YouTube, or any other social media platform. Not putting my name (legal name or alias name) on any legal documents. That includes his social media friends such as ""Prism"". Also a cease and desist from the use of any of my images, photos or content on all social media platforms. I will do the same as well, there will be no future content from me or any of my channels regarding him. I want the respondent, James Dillard to STOP making misrepresentations. That includes stop sending false takedown notices and counter-notices to me and other content creators that use fair use.

2)Having his claim for infringement, docket number #:23-CCB-0266, to be dismissed with prejudice so he can not file it again.

3)Preventing James Dillard from copyrighting his work with case#: 1-12843823841 with copyright.gov. He only created that case as a stalling strategy and to further harm me and the other content creators that used a screen shot photo of him as a thumbnail.

4)I'm seeking damages of $5,000. The amount includes filing fees, current legal representation, future legal representation, potential loss revenue from YouTube, my interest in freedom of expression, along with pain and suffering from not being able to defend myself against his false allegations.

5)To have James Dillard to drop both federal cases that contain my name. The cases will be attached to this claim. Also to drop any false cyberstalking reports, false TRO's, and any other police reports that contain my name.

6)Since the respondent has made videos degrading my reputation online, he needs to write a formal apology to the YouTube Legal & Copyright Department and suggest to them it was all a mistake and to have them restore ALL of my YouTube channels back as if nothing happened. There were no community violations that were done by Kenneth Rucker.

7)I would highly need the CCB staff attorneys to give me information about obtaining a subpoena under 17 USC 512 (h), which may help me obtain information from an online service provider to identify the other respondent on this claim, James Dillard's online friend that helped him create these false misrepresentation claims, ""Prism"". She specifically has been making online threats towards me and other content creators. The threats have been ongoing for months and it includes financial and physical. It's gotten so bad that I had to file a cybercrime report with the FBI and my local police department against both of them. James Dillard may have given her my contact information through the YouTube copyright counter notices that I sent and I'm concerned for my safety.

8)Because he has been abusing and violating the Digital Milliennium Copyright Act - 17 U.S.C. 512(f) DMCA law, James Dillard needs to be permanently removed from the YouTube platform."

23-CCB-0396,Luke v. Smith,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/6054,"These are the exact quotes from the counter-notice that Keegan Smith sent to me via YouTube:

""Because I [Keegan Smith] own the full rights to the video, this strike is false and he [Tiffany Luke] should be getting in legal trouble for it, so its a fraudulent strike, and I 100% own the thumbnail.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.""","There is no question that I (Tiffany Luke) am the owner of the video that Keegan is claiming the rights to. The video features my husband and dog and was filmed in my living room. The video was also posted originally to my Instagram account back in 2020 and my YouTube account in 2021, way before Keegan started reposting them on their account in 2022.

It is incredibly harmful for Keegan to claim ownership over my video that I worked so hard to create. I was the one who put in all the time and energy into planning, coordinating, shooting, and editing the video. Additionally, my husband has not given Keegan permission to post his likeness.

Additionally, it's also harmful that Keegan is claiming ownership even though they know full well that they are not the owner of the video. Soon after my initial copyright removal request was approved by YouTube, Keegan had sent me an email through his clickyt0021@gmail.com email address under the name Kiara admitting they had uploaded content that did not belong to them and begging me to withdraw my copyright removal request. 

It has been incredibly stressful for me to deal with someone claiming ownership of my work and now having to take the time to put together this claim and all the evidence to ensure that my copyright ownership is held in place.

As for relief, I want Keegan to withdraw their counter-notice and to stop harassing me via email and through counter-notices about getting their YouTube account back."

He responded to my request by removing any credit he had on his works description.","This has caused me stress, as it is very hard for a non-U.S. resident to start a copyright infringement claim in a federal court.

23-CCB-0340,Hill v. Aichwalder,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5485,I swear under penalty of perjury that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled by mistake or because of misidentification of the material.,"To begin I must state that the particular copyright work (Soccer Skeleton Overhead Kick Soccer Player Halloween Moon) that is the subject of this proceeding was intended to be available (offered for sale) solely through my own sales account located on the Amazon.com Merch on Demand marketplace platform. The copyright work was uploaded by me to the Amazon.com Merch on Demand platform to be sold only as a design printed on physical products such as shirts, tote bags, hoodies, etc. No digital download of this product is or was offered nor any authorized by myself or Amazon.com. The only method anyone can legally obtain this copyright work is through the purchase of products offered by Amazon.com that include the design printed on it. All other uses are unauthorized.

The activity of Erica Aichwalder has contributed to a loss of sales revenue that is incalculable due to the nature of this type of copyright infringement. The respondent somehow obtained an unauthorized copy of my copyright work and created a listing on etsy.com which offered it for sale to the public as a digital download in the form of a PNG file with transparent background. 

The Respondents listing title included the phrase ""Soccer Skeleton Overhead Kick Soccer Player Halloween Moon, Png For Shirt, Png Files For Sublimation, Digital Download, Printable"" which mislead all buyers to believe that Erica Aichwalder had the rights to resell my copyright work and that they, the buyer, were also being given the right to use and resell my copyright work on products such as T-shirts and other items that the design could be printed on. 

The respondent's activity has helped to distribute my copyright work without my permission to an unknown quantity of people, both within and outside the United States, that in turn may and most likely have created products which compete with my own listings located on the Amazon.com marketplace. This includes but is not limited to using my unauthorized copyright work to sell products not only on other platforms such as a private ecommerce website, etsy.com, teepublic.com, redbubble.com, zazzle.com but also Amazon.com as well which directly competes with my own original listings created with my own copyright work. 

The respondent's activity has directly contributed to and increased the unauthorized use and spread of my copyright work both within and outside the United States. The result is that my ability to sell and profit from my own copyright work has been diminished significantly.   

In fact I have had to issue numerous takedown requests since listing my copyright work on the Amazon.com marketplace and I have no doubt that some may be the result of Erica Aichwalder's activity which allowed people to purchase an unauthorized hi-resolution copy of my copyright work for a mere $1.20

This not only harms me financially but contributes to my mental stress as well as adding extra work load to my schedule which I do not get paid for. Rather than using my time to create designs I am forced to waste my time tracking down unauthorized copies of my work and trying to protect it from those like the respondent who deem that theft is okay."
23-CCB-0338,Schultz v. Thompson,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5440,"This was an obvious matter of fair use. Percentage, subject matter, and otherwise make it salient for public consumption and access. Thompson's behavior and words are shocking and dangerous and YouTube was well aware of Thompson at this time, therefore they should answer to the content.

I believe that the copyright board should rule on whether or not my posting the entire video a month later was infringement or not. This is a matter I have had to take to the courts in order to prevent further harm. In the video that I posted, Mr. Thompson clearly describes putting a hypothetical person through the exact torment he placed me through. It was very near an admission and I believe posting it was vital to the knowledge of users on YouTube. Under significant duress and determined to never have someone suffer Thompson's wrath with copyright abuse, I posted the video because I believe YouTube is denying and ignoring the stark reality of predators utilizing their platforms for very devastating utility.  I welcome judgment on the issue of whether or not Thompson, who most likely doesn't have a copyright for this video, is infringement and not fair use as it demonstrates the operations of bad actors on the internet. I believe I acted in good faith and for good purpose to the public good.","Mr. Thompson routinely infringed my copyrights, prior to registration on many counts (I am looking for aid in retrieving every stolen mp4 or video Thompson published, and I would like immediate preregistration for a feature film to be released next year). Additionally, he used live chat function from YouTube to harass me in order to provoke content, which is a matter of jurisdiction for the state of California. The copyright infringement, nonetheless operates in that context. This is a person who steals people's copyrights and posts hundreds of edited clips in order to harass, shame and defame. I want every video returned to me that Thompson published since 2021 and I want them registered and I would like to take him to court prior to March 2024 in order to obtain actionable damages and special damages on the infringement of what is my content to register."

She admitted in her counterclaim that the video I created my work from was a publicly released video by law enforcement, then further on she claimed that I can't claim copyright on my work involving that video because it didn't ""belong"" to me.

23-CCB-0331,van Niekerk v. TMG | Trident Media Guard,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/5368,"Misrepresentation 1: ""I state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:
I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and This notification is accurate. I acknowledge that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages. I understand that abuse of this tool will result in termination of my YouTube channel. 
Authorized Signature: Bastien Casalta""

Reason for Misrepresentation 1:
In response to the takedown notice issued by TMG, represented by Mr. Bastien Casalta, I wish to assert that this notice presents a fundamental misrepresentation regarding the nature of my videos and their relation to copyright law, particularly the ""fair use"" provisions.

Mr. Casalta's notice states ""UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY"" that he believes my use of the material ""is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law."" I contend that this assessment is fundamentally flawed for the following reasons:

Purpose and Character of Use: My videos aren't replicas or mere reproductions of the original rugby matches. They undergo considerable transformation. Using CoachPaint, I edit, annotate, and introduce graphical effects to illuminate rugby laws' intricacies. This transformative use, accompanied by my educational commentary, establishes a different purpose from the original broadcasts.

Nature of the Copyrighted Work: The original rugby matches, while copyrighted, serve a distinct purpose from my videos. My videos are analytical and educational, not replays. They provide a comprehensive view of specific game aspects, underscoring the essence of fair use.

Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used: I employ only selected segments of the game, representing a tiny fraction of the entire content. Out of 2,000-3,000 rugby events in a game, my focus is on just 10-25. This selective use emphasizes the educational aspect, differing starkly from the original broadcast's intent.

Effect on the Market: My videos address a unique niche, focusing on refereeing analysis—a perspective barely covered on platforms like YouTube. They neither substitute nor detract from the original broadcasts but foster a deeper appreciation of the game.

Mr. Casalta's declaration, asserting that my content's use ""is not authorized by the law,"" seems to dismiss the well-established provisions of ""fair use"" within copyright law. The law explicitly allows for transformative, educational use like mine.

Given the tenets of fair use and the unique nature of my content, TMG's claim appears to be a misrepresentation. I would like to remind the you of Section 512(f) of the DMCA, which Mr. Casalta referenced: any person who ""knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages."" I believe my videos squarely fall within fair use, and TMG's takedown notice, in failing to recognize this, has done a disservice to the broader rugby community and YouTube's platform.","I would like to highlight the extensive repercussions and losses that I, as a dedicated and hardworking content creator, have faced due to World Rugby's undue actions.

Projected Revenue Loss: The World Cup represents a significant influx in viewership for rugby-related content. Using a single video as a benchmark that garnered 230k views and generated $900 in a short span, and juxtaposing it against my historic channel metrics, I was poised to make around $1,500 for this one video alone. Had I been able to post the 8 videos that were planned for the duration of the World Cup, with a conservative estimate of $500 each in revenue, the projected earnings would have been $4,000. This amount excludes potential revenue from increased sponsorships and partnerships, which are commonplace during such high-profile events.

Opportunity Cost: The World Cup is a quadrennial event, which means lost opportunities during this period are not recoverable until four years later. This is not just a month of lost revenue; it's a loss of four years' worth of specialized content capitalization.

Algorithmic Penalization: YouTube's algorithm is intricate. With these unjust strikes, my channel has faced a significant algorithmic setback, seeing a 60-80% drop in views on older videos. Given the way YouTube operates, regaining this lost ground is not just about waiting for the strikes to be removed; it can take months, even years, to reestablish a channel's standing.

Loss of Potential Subscribers: Considering the heightened interest in rugby during the World Cup, my channel's growth was stunted at a crucial juncture. Given the ripple effect of every subscriber bringing in more through word of mouth, shares, and recommendations, the loss isn't just of the immediate subscribers, but of the potential exponential growth I was poised to experience.

Reputation and Trust Damage: Trust, once lost, is hard to regain. The perceived legitimacy of my content has been questioned due to these takedowns, affecting not only viewer trust but also potential collaborations, sponsorships, and partnership opportunities. This loss, although intangible, has long-term repercussions on my earning potential and credibility.

Emotional and Mental Distress: Beyond the financial and reputational losses, the stress and emotional turmoil caused by this ordeal shouldn't be understated. I've invested time, effort, and passion into my channel, and to see it unjustly penalized takes a toll on my well-being.

Given the depth and breadth of the damages and losses sustained, a claim of $30,000 isn't arbitrary or capricious. It's a justified compensation for the multifaceted negative impacts I've been subjected to. Beyond this monetary claim, I reiterate the need for a public apology from World Rugby and the immediate removal of these baseless strikes against my channel and abstain from repeatedly targeting my content with baseless claims that show a blatant disregard for the principles of Fair Use and copyright laws."

The respondent agreed to add attribution to remedy the unauthorized use of the image, and indicated that would be completed by 8/9/23. The initial DMCA takedown notice was sent on 8/14/23, when several days had elapsed since the 8/9 date the respondent had provided, with no communication from the respondent that they needed additional time and continued promotion of the website with the infringing image posted. After the infrining content was initially taken offline on 8/15, the respondent contacted me by email asking for the violation request to be removed, suggesting that she had fulfilled the condition of adding attribution by adding a ""link"" and saying that she would take down the photo if the ""link"" was not acceptable. When I had checked the website on 8/15, several hours before I received confirmation that the infringing content was taken down, there was no ""link"" or attribution accompanying the image. I indicated in my email response in part that based on her actions up to that point, she needed to find a different image to use for that product listing. The full response is included in the copies of the correspondence, but she said in part ""I'm happy to do that...I understand your rights and your concerns."" 

Several days later I saw that the URL's that were taken down by Shopify were restored, my content was gone, and I expected that was the end of it, and I had no intention of pursing it further. On 9/2/23 I was scrolling through Facebook and saw a sponsored post for the respondent's website. I clicked on it and saw that the listing and my photograph were back on the site, and there was no attempt to provide attribution for the image in the listing. I sent a second DMCA takedown request to Shopify on 9/2/23 and received notification from Shopify on 9/5 that the content listed as infringing in the original Takedown Notice had been taken offline. About one hour later I received notifcation from Shopfiy that the the respondent had responded to the DMCA Takedown Notice with a Counter Notice, indicating that the content was taken down as the result of a mistake or misidentification of the work. The email indicates that the material may be replaced and access no longer disabled within 10-14 days unless Shopify receives notice that I have filed an action against the Merchant. At this point the infringing image is not posted, but the 10-14 business days has not yet elapsed. 

Based on my communication via Facebook and email with the respondent prior to sending the second takedown notice, the respondent made a misrepresentation in filing the counter claim, and knew that the misrepresentation was false, because they had already acknowledged that I am the copyright owner, acknowledged that they used the image withouth permission, and had agreed to discontinue use of the image after they failed to add attribution in a timely manner. Even though the respondent claims that they did add a ""link"" as attribution prior to the content being taken down the first time, I did not ever see evidence attribution was added, and screen capture video and images of the website after the repost show that there was no attribution for the image, so it is not possible that this is a miscommunication about attribution.","I am seeking damages for the harm caused by the misrepresentation. When I became aware of the copyright infringement I immediately notified the respondent but offered the respondent continued use the image contingent on attribution being added, which would have allowed the unauthorized use to be quickly and simply resolved for both parties. Instead of just adding image attribution to the written description for the listing, the respondent chose to continue to use the image without authorization, and then to further escalate the unauthorized use by making false statements in the counter-notice they filed, which will result in their ability to repost the image as a listing photo on their site. Ranunculus corms are typically shipped in the fall in the United States, and although they are dormant, are a perishable product. As a result of the second DMCA takedown, the specific listing using the work is not active on the website, which means that customers are not able to order the inventory the respondent has purchased. Without taking additional legal steps against the respondent, the misrepresentation in the counter claim will allow the respondent to have this listing with the photo active again, and continue to profit off the unauthorized use of my work."

Respondent also boasted that Exam Pros LLC has been successful in defending against other claims of copyright infringement, specifically, a claim against Respondent by the American Institute of Architects (AIA).

As the Designated DMCA Agent of https://shemale6.com, I understand that content creators may wish to have their videos removed from our website, and we are working diligently to improve our approach in this regard.

However, I'm a bit unsure how we can be held responsible for entire pages like https://www.shemale6.com/search/Porcelaingoirl-fe/, which is solely owned by shemale6.com. Personally, I believe this is an abuse of the DMCA system. It's worth noting that we've already removed thousands of search queries in response to DMCA requests.

While we do encourage content creators to file DMCA requests for videos they own, it's important to keep in mind that they don't have ownership over specific search queries or a specific section of our website.

I hope this makes sense, and I kindly ask that you remove it from your list. Thanks.

Sincerely, Peter Maina

23-CCB-0224,Davis v. Milano,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3773,"""Etsy received a report of copyright infringement from Michelle Milano alleging that certain content in your Etsy shop infringe their intellectual property.""

This board has repeatedly informed Michelle that her copyright does not cover preexisting material or the idea or process of creating a Fairy Orb. Her copyright protects her specific look of her Fairy Orb.

Michelle has also stated on more than one occasion to have extensive knowledge of copyright law. Therefore it is reasonable to believe that she knew the protections and limitations of her copyright registration each time she filed a DMCA against me and multiple other sellers on Etsy.

Every time Michelle files a claim with the board, she adjusts what materials she uses to create her Fairy Orbs. In her amended claim from 23-CCB-0066, she now includes ""a ribbon to hang and hide the topper."" This information was not included in her copyright registration or her other claims. It also doesn't appear to be something she did in 2012. However, this is something that I have always done with my work. I am not trying to state that Michelle can't use a ribbon, but that it would appear she has chosen to include this information to support her allegation that my work is a derivative of her own.

I believe she is doing this because, as this board has told her, my work does not contain a clay hand-sculpted fairy strikingly similar to hers. My work does not include any fairy. 

Etsy has a very powerful tool for reporting intellectual property infringement. https://www.etsy.com/ipmanager Since Michelle has targeted so many sellers, I assume she is utilizing this tool. I signed up for this tool myself to investigate. It allows you to search keywords and bring up listings to report multiple listings simultaneously (I believe Etsy limits you to 500 listings per report). 

When I searched for ""fairy orbs"" with Etsy's IP manager, I did not see any listings that were substantially similar to hers or mine. However, when I searched ""witch ball"" and ""spell ball,"" my work and the works of other impacted sellers appeared. 

This tool relies on searching listing titles, product descriptions, and tags to identify keywords and produce search results. Since I did not use the keywords ""fairy orbs"" ANYWHERE in my listings, it is reasonable to conclude that my listings would not be displayed if Michelle searched for ""fairy orbs"" within Etsy's IP portal.

With this information, It is reasonable to conclude that Michelle could not have searched for fairy orbs when using this tool to file DMCA takedowns and that she had to have searched for ""witches balls"" and/or ""spell balls.""

Michelle has also shared posts on social media where she states that she deliberately targets certain people. In a Facebook post she shares a screenshot of an email from an upset seller responding to a DMCA that Michelle sent. This is her caption for the screenshot:  ""people like this are the type you deliberately target I've learned.... Smfh- I'll just forward it to the copyright offices attorneys"" 

It would also appear that Michelle only engages in this activity when trying to establish her own business. Her claim in 2021 fell in line with her starting an Etsy shop. These most recent claims have been timed with the launch of her new website and the re-launch of her Etsy shop.

However, in Michelle's amended claim for case 23-CCB-0066, she admits that she files DMCA claims against other makers to mark the anniversary of receiving her copyright:

""This harassment and juvenile tactics STARTED completely from a 2 week DCMA down on Etsy on the ANNIVERSARY of my receiving my first copyright. Which is why it was done at that time, my flagging and DCMA'ing the account(s) had nothing to do with holidays whatsoever, only the ANNIVERSARY of my getting my first copyright.""

Michelle's copyright was granted in September 2012, but her DMCA filings happened in November 2021 and March 2023. These filings do not align with the anniversary of her copyright registration. Furthermore, this admission suggests that she intentionally files these DMCA requests that have real-world impacts on the lives of her victims to celebrate her being granted a copyright registration and not because we are infringing upon her work.

Michelle recently announced a new copyright registration for ""Goddess Globes."" on social media. (VAu001495751 / 2023-03-10) This announcement is video cut with a photo of a woman making an obscene hand gesture, suggesting that this registration is not to protect her work but to try and get back at me now that the legitimacy of the enforcement of her Fairy Orb copyright has come under scrutiny. Her announcement shows no examples of her work and states, ""new items coming soon!!""

Michelle had her Etsy shop shut down for fraudulent practices and doxxing a customer. Since she no longer has access to Etsy, she has recently filed DMCA takedown requests to other makers of spell balls on Pinterest, claiming their photographs as her intellectual property. In addition to Pinterest, Michelle has filed DMCA takedowns on other platforms, including Instagram, where I received two DMCAs for one photo and one video that she falsely claimed was her intellectual property.

All of these facts lead me to no other conclusion than that Michelle knew my work did not infringe upon her copyright but filed 21 DMCA takedown requests on Etsy against me anyway. Therefore, when she informed Etsy that ""certain content in your Etsy shop infringe their intellectual property,"" she was knowingly lying and making false statements.","Financial loss. Whenever the respondent files a DMCA notice against me, I cannot sell my product on Etsy for 12-14 days. I have lost an estimated $648 in potential sales over 48 days. This rate was determined by an average of one sale per day at $13.50. The respondent is aware of this amount, as she has received and viewed an initial invoice sent to her via Paypal for $621 on April 6, 2023. I have since sent two updated invoices for a total of $1,491. She has not responded to any invoices.

While some of my listings can be relisted per DMCA laws, Michelle has not withdrawn any of the 21 complaints against me, which results in reduced traffic to my shop, as my search ranking is affected.

The respondent has used social media platforms in an attempt to falsely accuse me of theft of copyright, damaging my personal and business reputation. The respondent has also engaged in bullying, harassment, and stalking. She continues to make defamatory and libelous statements about me and my business on her social media pages. The loss in sales from this is not calculable. 

Due to the respondent's continued claims with Etsy I have had to spend numerous hours building my own website, as well as purchasing a Shopify subscription at $39 a month, totaling $468 per year, a $12 fee to change my website hosting service to Google Domains for easier setup and $140 towards obtaining a P.O. Box for my safety after the respondent used my personal information gathered from my counter notice to send me harassing mail via USPS, as well as $100 to file this claim to protect my business and character. Additionally, I have spent time rebuilding listings on Etsy, filing counternotices, chasing defamatory posts on social media, and issuing DMCA notices of my own against Michelle. I have spent several hours searching for information about her Fairy Orbs (after she refused me access to her work on two separate occasions), consulting with lawyers, speaking to the police, studying copyright law, reading her filings and claims, reviewing evidence, and building my own CCB case. My billable time for this is $60/hr for 60 hours for $3,600.

These fees total: $5,811

Michelle also (after receiving a cease and desist letter from me that she signed for) published my full name, address, phone number, and email address in two pieces of evidence attached to a publicly available amended claim for case 23-CCB-0066. This has made me feel unsafe and fear for the safety of my family. Michelle has been public about this filing on social media and knowingly posted my private contact information, knowing anyone could view it. I am grateful for this board's quick response in removing that information from public view. 

Michelle has threatened me publicly, stating, ""goodbye 2 ton thief wanna take care of things without an attorney come knock on my door.... I'm more than happy to oblige and settle out of court.... MY way"" and  ""I'm gonna take care of you, you fat fucking cunt."" 

Michelle created a Facebook page called ""Harassment & Cyberstalking,"" where she alleges that she is ""collecting evidence"" against me. However, this is a thinly veiled excuse to humiliate me and try and affect my business further publicly. In one post, Michelle states that the existence of this page is  my fault, stating: ""Lets see....  this all started because someones infringing copyright and refused to stop....""

Most recently, Michelle's actions have led to my TikTok page being permanently banned for ""multiple reports of violent extremism."" My TikTok account was the biggest driver of my sales. While I cannot explicitly prove at this time that Michelle filed the reports that got me banned, the ban happened after reports of my videos about this situation were reported for ""harassment & bullying.""

This ban has halted nearly all traffic to my website and Etsy shop. The total loss in sales from her deliberate actions is incalculable. 

The respondent has also utilized my logo to impersonate me online, where she accuses me of copyright theft and claims my business is being shut down. Michelle has also claimed my photos and video as her own on Instagram, filing two fraudulent DMCA notices against me. I have spent hours chasing these down, responding to them, and filing my own DMCA notices against her to protect my business and reputation.

Since I cannot quantify the lost revenue from the defamation of character and false statements against me, I am seeking an additional $5,000 in damages for the attacks against my business, reputation, and character.

I am also requesting an additional $2,500 in punitive damages for the emotional suffering incurred from her actions.

The total amount of monetary relief I am requesting is $13,311.

I am also requesting the CCB order that Michelle Milano can no longer file DMCA claims without advisement from a competent intellectual property lawyer to prevent her from attacking my business or any other business again. This type of order is not unprecedented; see case 3:22-cv-00578:

23-CCB-0222,READ ASAP LTD v. Miracle,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3724,"According to Section 107 of the U.S. Copyright Act, the infringing website in question does not qualify as fair use. Therefore, their claim of having the right to use the content is a misrepresentation.

Let's analyze the four factors that determine fair use:

1）Purpose and character of the use: The purpose of the pirate novel website is not for personal reading but for profit, as evidenced by the presence of advertisements. This constitutes a commercial purpose of use.

b）Nature of the copyrighted work: Creative works are entitled to greater copyright protection than factual works. Our novel is a creative work with a certain degree of originality.

c）Amount and substantiality of the portion used: Users can download the complete PDF version of the novel through this website. As a paid reading work, we generally provide only around 10% of the content for free as a promotional purpose. The website in question has clearly exceeded this limit.

d）Effect of the use upon the market: This factor includes the extent of the harm and other relevant factors. The actions of the pirate website directly lead to a decrease in user retention, reduced click-through rates, diminished advertising revenue, decreased income and quantity of paid or membership-based subscriptions, resulting in significant harm to our company.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the infringing website's claim is a misrepresentation.","Regarding the claim we are pursuing, our company has obtained exclusive authorization from the author to publish our works on our platform. However, a significant number of our exclusive works have been unlawfully placed on a pirate website (https://forum.3ptechies.com) without our permission, and we have been unable to establish contact with the operators of this website. We have made consistent efforts to address this issue by filing complaints through Google search and submitting takedown notices to Google in accordance with the provisions of the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) Section 512.

Unfortunately, despite our efforts, the pirate website has falsely claimed to have the right to use our works, resulting in ongoing infringement. Many of our works have been registered with the United States Copyright Office, and their presence on this website unequivocally does not constitute fair use. This unauthorized use directly harms our platform, leading to reduced user retention, decreased click-through rates, diminished advertising revenue, as well as reduced revenue and quantity from paid or membership-based services. The damages inflicted upon our company are substantial.

We request that the operator of this website promptly take down all of our exclusive works, including but not limited to the following URLs:

23-CCB-0217,Fintelegram v. Capital Solutions Ltd,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3674,"These 2 websites, filled a fake DMCA counternotice. And here you find all the details:

1. They mentioned sending this DMCA from a company called Capital Solutions Ltd with the address 56 Chapman Road STE 105, Newark, Delaware, USA, 19702 and phone number +9018918888
If you check the Delaware Register of Companies, there isn't any company with this name. Plus they used an Indian phone number. We tried to call and is not active. Also, the email domain they used, the website is not existing and used the email account just to email and fill the fake DMCA.

2. They used the sender name Gen Lanza, but if you check, it's the same name present in the articles we asked to shut down for DMCA copyright
https://www.gripeo.com/gennaro-lanza-review/
https://www.gripeo.com/gennaro-lanza/
https://www.criminalaffair.com/int/gennaro-lanza/
Then they used a fake sender name just to counternotice.

Also, they sent about the same links also a second DMCA takedown, but this time with another company, name and email:
Company Gripeo LLC
Email bz@liaisons.co
Name Nathan Howards

They declared in both cases the UK residence. 

But the IP connection was for both from India. It's absolutely clear about the fake DMCA.

Long short story: they sent a fake DMCA using a fake name, fake company, fake address and fake phone number.

You can also realize this from the Lumen database, the website Gripeo.com received hundreds of DMCA takedowns for breaching copyrights.","They are trying to restore the pages with a fake DMCA.
But their IP is from India as for the email received from Google.

23-CCB-0215,"Gharavi v. FloSports, Inc.",https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/3671,"Misrepresentation: ""I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.""

Explanation of the misrepresentation: The respondent sent YouTube twenty (20) takedown notices claiming my online content was infringing.  In stating under penalty of perjury that FloSports, Inc. is the “the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed”, the respondent did knowingly make twenty (20) misrepresentations because they knew that they were not the actual owner of the copyright to any of my twenty (20) videos to which I own the exclusive copyright.  The aforementioned misrepresentations were critical to YouTube’s decision in that it relied upon said misrepresentations in deciding to take down all twenty (20) videos.","Upon receipt of the twenty (20) misrepresented DMCA notices, YouTube disabled all twenty (20) videos and assessed four (4) copyright strikes against my channel, resulting in the channel being scheduled for termination within seven (7) days pending adjudication of the twenty (20) counter notices.  When a channel is scheduled for termination, no new content can be published.  It took YouTube nineteen (19) days to adjudicate fifteen (15) of the counter notices, resulting in the restoration of my ability to publish.  In addition to the financial harm caused by disabling access to those videos during those nineteen (19) days, over the same time period I was unable to publish my minimum once-daily new content, and as a result, viewership dramatically declined over that time period and still has yet to recover due YouTube’s algorithm deprioritizing channels which do not regularly publish.  Although this has resulted in significant actual monetary damages as well as damage to my reputation, I am willing to defer seeking financial relief if the respondent is willing to agree to stop making misrepresentations and to stop sending false takedown notices."

This is a misrepresentation as Spotify does not allow Third Parties to use artist's art cover and brand (essentially) to promote other items on different websites. What would Beyonce Knowles and her camp do if he (Jesse) used her works on his site? Why didn't he attempt this on a major artist? 
He targets artists who he knows/thinks may not come after him financially, but who are popular in the Google search space. This is why he purposefully chose me and my song, because I am popular but not at the level of a major artist or label.","Google has told me that I have to file a lawsuit or submit a claim here - to the Copyrights Claim Board - to continue the dispute process, or they will reinstate the Gemtracks link in the search engine.

Message: Dear Michelle,
I am a junior editor at a small publishing house in Marseille, France, called Le bruit du monde (which roughly translates as ""the sounds of the world"").
We are going to publish a translation into French of the memoir/autobiographical essay of a young Norwegian writer and researcher, Jan Grue. In his memoir, he deals with the issue of being a disabled man in a world that isn't meant for him to fit in, and also tells us about how he eventually came to terms with his extra-ordinary being-in-the-world, and learned to accept it. His voice is strong and we wanted to make it heard to French readers.
In his book, he reminisces on how living in Amsterdam as an exchange student was both a wonderful and trying experience : the cobblestone streets, the canals, the city itself weren't meant to welcome a person in a wheelchair, and yet he came to love it and its atmosphere. He specifically remembers listening to your song again and again, ""5 am in Amsterdam"". He quotes 5 lines of the song in his book, and we were wondering if we could quote those lines too in our edition. Being a huge fan of yours, I thought I'd reach out personally.
Looking forward to hearing from you,
Many thanks for your attention,
Léa

Dear Léa
I'm pleased to hear from you concerning licensing the lyrics from my song ""5 AM in Amsterdam"" for the memoir I LIve a Life Like Yours by Jan Grue.
A few thoughts come to mind:
Why, I wonder, was this not first brought to my attention by Pushkin Press when Mr. Grue's book was published in English, apparently on November 4, 2021? Was there a prior publication in Norway as well?

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/15/books/review/i-live-a-life-like-yours-jan-grue.html

It has been my experience that licensing my lyrics for print publication typically brings other considerations: online lyric display and keyword search.
Your brief outline below did not mention these, but trademark enforcement for keyword search becomes a consideration, particularly in relation to Amazon's predatory online marketplace.
I will be happy to discuss a licensing proposal for print lyric display and will trust that the context for my lyrics are as you represented, and not as a subtext or otherwise subversive implication for my work or reputation.
Or welcome to provide me with an English version of the manuscript, to determine for myself.
Any information or contact you can provide for the author's prior publishing representatives is also appreciated.
Kind regards,
Michelle Shocked

Dear Michelle,
Thank you so much for getting back to me so quickly!
I understand your concern if I’m the first editor to ask to license your lyrics – the book was indeed first printed in Norwegian, then in the US, I believe. I haven’t been in touch with those editors, but I’m sure you can find the information online.
As for the respect of your lyrics, you may be certain that we are quoting them verbatim, the five lines I mentioned, not as a subtext but as a text per se – here is the passage in full (I’m adding my translation into English, in purple) :

Tous les jours, je passais à côté du musée Anne-Frank et de l’église qui se dresse à côté. Les cloches sonnaient tous les quarts d’heure. J’écoutais en boucle ≪ 5 A.M. in Amsterdam ≫ de Michelle Shocked, issue de son album intitulé The Texas Campfire Tapes. (Every day, I would walk past the Anne Frank museum and the church that stands next to it. The bells chimed every fifteen minutes. I listened to “5 A.M. in Amsterdam” by Michelle Shocked, from her album The Texas Campfire Tapes, again and again.)

It’s 5 a.m. in Amsterdam
And this is how I know
There’s a church beside a park
And it fills the dying dark
With five strokes
There it is again

Je ne connais aucune autre chanson qui colle mieux à cette ville, et je la trouve toujours aussi romantique. Quinze ans se sont écoulés depuis mon séjour, mais ces paroles suffisent à me renvoyer là-bas. Même si je n’ai jamais été aussi seul que cet automne-là, j’ai besoin d’entendre régulièrement sa mélodie, sa voix. (No song that I know fits the city better than this one, which always seems so romantic to me. Fifteen years have passed since my stay, yet those words are enough to take me back. Even though I’ve never been so lonely as I was that fall, I need to hear her melody, her voice, regularly).

I really think it’s a lovely tribute to your work and this specific song. That’s why we wanted to keep it in our edition, but I know license has to be asked in order to do so. We typically pay around $60 to be given permission to quote from a song or book, and my editor in chief is more than willing to do for your lyrics.
I hope we can work this out together, be assured that we are no Amazon (the mere name makes my teeth itch), just a small publishing house keen on respecting artists’ rights and proud to represent our own authors.
Yours,
Léa

Dear Lea
I realize you work under deadlines, so please give me a time frame that you would like this license request resolved by.
Meanwhile, I have reached out to Pushkin Press and hope to hear from them.
In case it's of interest, I will be on tour in France Oct 15-31, primarily based around Lyon.*
Also, I would gladly consider collaborating with your own marketing efforts for the French release, either with social media or live events, as well as available for media opportunities related to 5 AM. in Amsterdam.

Hi Michelle,
Thanks for considering our deadlines, it is always a bit tight, and editing the translation into French has kept me too busy to be looking into licensing matters, which my colleague was supposed to handle. Ideally, if you could make a proposal by next Tuesday, it would be great. Our legal adviser said that if we couldn’t settle on a license we’d just have to give up on the quote, but it’s such a nice tribute, I think it’d be a shame.
Thanks for sharing the concert dates, I’ll definitely be on the lookout, Lyon is close to my hometown!
All best,
Léa

Dear Michelle,
Thank you for your message, I understand. From what I know on our end in France, we must ask for permission because there is no equivalent of “Fair Use”, as in the States, which makes it possible to quote a few lines as in this case.
I will keep the edited translation on hold to see whether we keep the quote from “5 A.M. in Amsterdam” or not.
All best,

In conclusion, I am certain the two facts are related, but how does one explain or prove this in a tribunal if the judges are not familiar with facts on the ground as they are happening in real time to songwriters left to protect themselves against the vicissitudes of predatory AI technology while these same DSPs are protected by DMCA safe harbors?

The developer does not have a good understanding of DMCA. I have explained that the claim is not about the nature of the app, design, functionality/ behaviour, logo, colour and etc, but the developer tries to justify these things.

I would like to emphasize that the developer of the ""Qamoos Dictionary"" does not claim ownership of the data.

I reinvest the income generated to improve the app. Since the ""Infringed app"" published, the number of users using our application decreased which resulted in decreased revenue as well.

23-CCB-0113,Baron v. Boateng,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2499,"Samuel Boateng used his platform to promote a false narrative against myself alleging I am ""dangerous"" a ""serial allegator"" and that I am an ""easy pussy demon""",I want all of my work taken down from his websites and platforms and not to be uploaded again.
23-CCB-0106,Tarens v. Hottenstine,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2343,"David Hottenstine has attempted to take down the band White Fuzzy Bloodbath's (""WFB"") copyrighted music in bad faith by filing false
DMCA Notices in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 512(f).  

First, David has sent multiple DMCA notices in bad faith, starting on or around March 23, 2021. Specifically, he has sent notifications to third-party websites such as YouTube and Bandcamp in attempts to have WFB’s content removed from those websites, despite the fact that
the content is, at a minimum, jointly authored and owned by Ms. Tarens. The Copyright Act of 1976 defines a joint work as “a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.” 17 U.S.C. §
101. Joint ownership occurs when a copyright is owned in undivided share by more than one person. Joint ownership may occur in many circumstances, including if the work is a product of joint authorship. 1 Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 6A.07 (rev. ed. 2022). Absent a written agreement otherwise, the authors of a joint work jointly own the copyright in each other’s contributions and each author owns an undivided interest in the copyright for the work as a whole. 17 U.S.C. § 201(a).

The Copyright Office records provide a clear answer of the authors of the songs contained in WFB’s Sugar & Rock album. Elise Tarens, Andreas Tsampoukos, and David Hottenstine are listed as the authors under copyright registration PA0002286134 for Works Published on the
Album Sugar & Rock. See also 17 U.S.C. § 410(c) (registration within five years of publication is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the registration). Joint authorship entitles Ms. Tarens to “the independent right to use or license the copyright subject only to a duty to account for any
profits he earns from the licensing or use of the copyright.” Ashton-Tate Corp. v. Ross, 916 F.2d 516 (9th Cir. 1990); See also 17 U.S.C. § 201(a); Thomson v. Larson, 147 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir. 1998); Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 846 F.2d 1485, 1498 (D.C. Cir. 1988), aff’d, 490 U.S. 730 (1989) (“Joint authors co-owning copyright in a work are deemed to be tenants in common, with each having an independent right to use or license the copyright, subject only to a duty to account to the other co-owner for any profits earned thereby.”). Accordingly, a joint
copyright owner may not exclude other joint owners or persons who have a license from another joint owner, and cannot sue another joint owner for infringement. Ms. Tarens has accounted for and sent to David Hottenstine his share of royalties with each use of the music. Whether or not
he chose to accept the payments – and he refunded the last two amounts of $19.83 on or around March 17, 2021, and $16.30 on or around August 4, 2021 – Ms. Tarens has satisfied her obligations to him under the Copyright Act. David Hottenstine has no rights, under operation of law or
otherwise, to enjoin Ms. Tarens from granting nonexclusive licenses to WFB’s music that she is a joint author of. This is the reason why each of Ms. Tarens’ counter-notices have been successful in reinstating WFB’s music online. 

David Hottenstine has asserted several bad faith DMCA claims under
knowledge of the above facts, knowing that the content does not infringe any copyright laws or rights.","Ms. Tarens has had rightfully-owned content taken down several times, interfering with her potential business opportunities. This has led to many missed and/or lost opportunities. Ms. Tarens is seeking damages, to the extent permitted by law, for David Hottenstine's conduct in bad faith."
23-CCB-0097,Lucas v. Dobroserdov,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2268,"The sender of the counter-notice considered himself the author of my articles

Based on that, specified facts are basis for consideration of misrepresentation of moshennik.eu and Viktor Dobroserdov as its representative.","As a self-employed person - journalist and analyst on a freelance, my articles are my only source of income, and the specialty and uniqueness of my work help me to support myself. So, the use of my intellectual property (my articles) without my permission deprives me of my means of livelihood.
Based on that, I kindly ask you to oblige the resource moshennik.eu and online service provider Google.com to remove my articles from the website moshennik.eu and Google search results."
23-CCB-0093,Sebrechts v. DMG Media,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2223,"The ""Selfie of Max Sebrechts"" copyrighted selfie picture has been shared by Jazmyn Jones who didn't get permission to do so. The incident was personal and entirely irrelevant to the rigging claims, which already have been proven to be false. The picture was shared by Jazmyn to Heather Lee O'Keefe, who contacted Ben Ashford and falsely used the works to support her false claim of rigging.","I was forced to step down from the organization, while none of these messages referred to had anything to do with my role at Miss USA. The suspension has been released in the meantime, but the article from DailyMail and all other online service providers copying Mr. Ashford's article. resulted in a solid harm suffered by not only Max Sebrechts, but his family and larger network. The article misrepresents Max Sebrechts and his photographic work ""Selfie of Max Sebrechts"" and therefore must be taken down. The publication by Online Service Provider was used purely with the objective of pursuing commercial gain and gain social attention, it breaches US copyright law and was not subject to any agreement between the parties."
23-CCB-0079,Linga v. CELIS-CAPISTRANO,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/2155,"Roann Celis-Capistrano and her lawyer described me as an internet imitator, who has intentionally stolen and infringed upon Plaintiff’s Copyrighted Work believing that distance created by a vast ocean would somehow insolate her from Copyright infringement: a crime in the Republic of Philippines wherein a warrant for arrest has been issued by the Philippine Government. I received no subpoena and I am an American Citizen which is outside of Philippine Jurisdiction. Roann Celis-Capistrano and her lawyer alleged that I made misrepresentations to You Tube, I explained why my video is fair use and Youtube accepted my explanation and that is not misrepresentation. Roann Celis-Capistrano and her lawyer alleged that I unjustly enriched myself among 
other things, obtaining profits, depriving Plaintiff of the compensation to 
which she is rightly entitled, and taking credit for Plaintiff’s original work. I do not sell anything, my videos are for public service and I only made $51 on the said video. Once my expenses are deducted such as internet, electricity, subscriptions and time, no profits were made from my Youtube channel. Its mainly for consumer protection and advocacy.","Because of Roann Celis-Capistrano's continued harassment, it caused severe distress, embarassment, pain and suffering from being wrongly accused of copyright infringement. My video has been taken down for 2 weeks so my audience was properly informed on how to calculate their retirement."

Violation point:
1. The style, tone, and elements are exactly the same.
2. The location and overall layout of each pattern are consistent with ours","1. A sharp drop in sales. We sell this product on Amazon and have a solid monthly sales of about $18,000. Since the respondent put the infringing product on the shelves, the two products are very similar, and it is easy for consumers to mistake them for the same one. Now our monthly sales have dropped to about 7000USD per month.
2. Double the cost of promotion. Due to the increased competition, our advertising expenses have also increased a lot. Before, the monthly advertising cost was about 600 US dollars per month, and now it costs about 1100 US dollars per month per month.
3. Increased management costs. Due to the increase in competition, the exposure of our products has also decreased accordingly. We can only ask the operation to spend more time to improve the position of the products on the website, so as to ensure that more consumers can see our products.
In response to this situation, we have complained to the respondent on the Amazon e-commerce platform. Amazon temporarily deleted the link of the respondent, but the other party counter-claimed on February 6, 2023 and asked Amazon to restore the link within 10 working days. If we do not submit a copy of the lawsuit by the specified time, the other party's merchandise will be sold normally."

Explanation: I was the 4-th significant contributor to this manuscript right after Pierre Hausfater, Liliana Tejidor, and Neus Robert Boter. The rest of the authors are gifted authors. I also contributed to the initial draft of the manuscript, which was completed by the end of July 2020. But my name was removed from the publication.

2)	Lie: SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical program was used for data analyses.
Explanation: I was the only person who knew and could use this software called SAS. This is a very specialized programming software only statisticians generally use. None of the Authors of this manuscript has expertise in SAS. But they claimed they used the SAS and conducted the data analysis.

3)	Lie: Data analysis was completed by PH, LT, LV, MC, CM, and NRB
Explanation: Again, I am the only one who conducted all data analyses using the software SAS. I produced every table and figure. None of the authors has minimal statistical expertise to conduct this level of analyses. But they claimed that they did the data analysis.

4)	Misrepresentation: The authors are also grateful to the following Beckman Coulter employees Mohamad Hasan and Gang Xu, for statistical support.
Explanation: I should be an author by ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editor) guidelines but I was removed from the authorship.","I am a young researcher. Every publication is very significant for my career growth, reputation, and job salary. Because of this unethical work, I cannot claim I am the manuscript's author, although I have made a significant contribution. Without my work, the manuscript could not have anything to write on. This is one of the works that I have done to be proud of. However, by plagiarism and by falsely calming my work to these authors’ work, they secured funds, whereas I can not. The company Beckman Coulter also secured profit from this publication and business relations with BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority).  In contrast, I have been going through so much stress and wasting my valuable time, which is approximately 400 hours, till today. I could use the same time for my career growth, consultancy, securing research funds, and also for publications.

I would like to see my authorship in this manuscript and appropriate credit for my work.  Also, I am compensated for the time I had to spend to resolve the dispute and for the added stress these authors and the institutions added to my daily life."

In 2018, the Infringer contacted me with the aim of selling my products by drop shipping scheme (buying from my Etsy account and selling through his social media accounts). There was an unsuccessful attempt at such cooperation, but he violated all agreements from the beginning and started selling not on social networks but on eBay.
In September 2018, I informed NAVED that I was stopping drop shipping support due to numerous violations. After that, the massive unauthorized use of my photos for the sale of fakes began.

This claim is false and a misrepresentation of my case as the recipe post that I have submitted a report initially for is a clear case of copyright infringement and Jamie Park is continuing to state that her work is completely original, despite the evidence I have provided in my report. I will be submitting further documentation to validate my case, which includes a side-by-side comparison of the two recipes. The recipe posted by Jamie Park is a copy of my recipe, in which the serving size has been modified to cover up this attempt. In the photo I will be providing, I have adjusted the serving size from 4 to 5, and the ingredient measurements are relatively the same, with the same exact cooking method. 

Moreover, in the original report I have submitted a screenshot that shows that Jamie Park has been modifying her recipe ratings to surpass my organic ratings, and this still stands valid today. On the day of the report, the number of ratings on cookerru.com was higher than drivemehungry.com. Although Jamie Park's post was taken down in the Google search results for nearly two weeks after the DMCA report was approved by Google on August 7th, the current number of 5-star ratings is 358, compared to 320 on cookerru.com, which is ranking currently at #1 for high-volume keywords and has an estimated traffic of 38,515, as per Keysearch. In comparison, the post published by Jamie Park has an estimated traffic of 4,047 despite the post showing a higher number of ratings than my original post. I will also be submitting this evidence in the documentation section.","Under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, I am requesting that Jamie Park's post continues to be removed from the Google search results, as the post contains material that was taken from my original post that took an immense amount of time and effort to share to my audience. Moreover, submitting the original DMCA report as well as this follow-up report has been extremely time-consuming in an effort to showcase proper objective evidence, and has taken away from the time I could have spent on my business and has in turn affected my overall revenue. I believe all creative work should be protected under the Copyright Law to protect the author's integrity and the amount of hard work and effort dedicated to creating each original post."

Statutory Damages: The infringing party has interfered with the publication, distribution and accounting mechanisms of Source Vibrations music by defrauding the account (TuneCore) under the email: fogleolina33@gmail.com. It's my belief that the infringing party altered the original account email, willfully falsified copyright ownership information within the TuneCore account and in statements made directly to TuneCore copyright agents in order to unscrupulously withdraw royalties. This has caused significant distress and financial hardship on me [the copyright owner], limiting my ability to conduct the business of promoting the infringed upon works and publishing additional works through this platform. 

Given the nature of the offense it is impractical to put a value on this hardship. Pursuant to title 17 of U.S. Code § 504, in the case where I [the copyright owner] “sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that infringement was committed willfully, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of $150,000.” The copyright owner will therefore seek the maximum relief for statutory damages in the event an injunction to prevent further infringing activity, or to gain access to the financial records and to the account in question is challenged in such a way as to require the copyright owner to accrue further legal fees. 

I [the copyright owner] am seeking relief in the following ways:  

1. A court order to restrain the infringing party from engaging in infringing activity. 2. I am seeking to gain access to the account and its financial records. 3. I am seeking damages in the amount of $30,000"
22-CCB-0023,Jaramillo v. Apple Inc.,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/54,They did not study my case. The actually ignore my first notification and I have to send a second notification. The simply ignored because the people who is making money from my work (which is not real information about them) don't want to take the material off and they denied my claim. I can take this individuos to court because I don't have any information about them,"This is cost me monetary lost, this material was confidential and academic. it is affecting my academic work and reputation. It is related academic work with Colombian drug cartels. I don't even know if my work is using for laundry money from drug cartel"
22-CCB-0021,Jaramillo v. YouTube,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/52,"YouTube ignored the Colombian Fiscalia report and I wrote them that the information of the counter notification was a fraud, it was fake. One of them refer to another work was done one year before for a film  (they also don't have the copyright for it) and the other registration the company confirmed me that the number was fake.","My academic work has damage, it has missleding my work. This work was confidential and it was for academic work. I am also worry that it may be used in laundry money from a Colombian drug cartel and who knows what else to organize crime and prostitution. My academic career has been serious damage and my finances because I had been under so much stress from the death threats from this drug cartel."
22-CCB-0020,Wright v. Potter,https://dockets.ccb.gov/claim/view/50,"Respondent swore under penalty of perjury that he had a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled by mistake or because of mis-identification of the material.

There was no misidentification of material as claimant's counsel is acutely aware of claimant's artwork and that the infringing listing by respondent was not authorized by claimant. Similarly, there was no mistake in removing the infringing content. Upon information and belief, respondent received an email from a third party seller on Etsy informing respondent to not use/resell the infringing design contained in the listing. 

Upon information and belief, respondent knowingly provided false and/or inaccurate information in the Counter-Notice for sole purpose of misleading claimant and Etsy so as to avoid liability from Plaintiff’s lawful claims, as well as to avoid termination of its ability to use Etsy’s services. Etsy maintains a repeat infringer policy and also has the ability to limit access to funds when an account owner is accused of infringement.","As a result of the misrepresentation, claimant has suffered specific harm in the form of attorney's fees and costs that it would not have incurred, but for the misrepresentation. Claimant is entitled to all damages associated with this matter, attorney’s fees, and any and all costs, as permitted by 17. U.S.C. §512(f)."
