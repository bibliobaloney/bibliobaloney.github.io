Claimant's photograph, which is still displayed publicly, was displayed alongside two blog posts promoting Respondents' goods and services. Claimant has never given Respondents permission or authority to copy or publicly display the photograph. Claimant notified Respondents of these allegations by email and by U.S. mail in December of 2020 and in March of 2021. Respondents never responded to these notices. As of filing, Respondents have removed the photograph from one portion of its website, the “Notes of the Field” page, but the photograph remains posted under the page “The Industrially Necessary Doctor Tedros,” and the images remain publicly accessible on Respondents' web servers.</td><td>Claimant is harmed by (1) the loss of licensing revenue, and (2) the lost scarcity value of the image which will negatively affect future licensing revenue. 

Under §1504(e)(1)(A)(ii) and §504(c) of the Copyright Act, Claimant is entitled to up to $15,000 statutory damages for the unauthorized use of the photograph, which was timely registered under §412 of the Act.</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffff">No claim certified, no orders to amend</td><td>Grant Heilman Photography, Inc.</td><td>Romano PLLC</td><td>Second Foundation Partners LLC</td><td>Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/23-CCB-0207">23-CCB-0207</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>stock recommendation based on research and computed metrics using machine learning</td><td>I, Suraj Waghulde, the owner of tickerrank.com , have built machine learning models that take data from intrinio.com and eodHistoricaldata.com and rank the stocks in different verticals like

were playing in the community park. Sameer is very interested in stock market investing and talked me into providing him all the details of the model and learned that the model output is
very good. Sameer copied all the ideas I had and along with his other friend Syed H Shah (who is
the official owner of therocketstocks.com) built therocketstocks.com exactly imitating my idea and data. They have a secret 50% - 50% partnership between Sameer Arora and Syed Shah as Sameer was not a permanent resident
of the US at the time I established my business https://www.tickerrank.com . Since I launched tickerrank.com in September 2020 therocketstocks.com has been

The publication could have occurred much earlier than March, but that is when a search was performed which showed the photo displayed on the website.   

Without seeking or receiving my permission, Trendey.com posted my copyrighted photograph on its commercial website, which is monetized through advertisements and affiliate referral fees.  The photograph is of a living room scene, and it was made for a client of mine who is an interior designer.  Screenshots of the infringing usage were made, which show the photo displayed on the homepage of Trendey.com, and as the large headline image at the top of the article in which it was used.  The unlicensed publication represents a clear infringement of my copyright to the photograph.  I acknowledge that the photograph has been removed from the Trendey.com site after my initial contact.  However, such removal, although required, does not address the issue of monetary damages resulting from the illegal copyright infringement.

Worth Star Telegram reporter obtained an unauthorized copy of our Braniff International Flight 352 Cockpit Voice Recording and  proceeded to post it on the Ft. Worth Star Telegram's website and on their YouTube page. We filed complaint with YouTube and the video of the transcript was taken down but Ft Worth Star Telegram filed a counter response, which has forced us to file this action. 

Please note that it is against Department of Transportation regulations  to release or distribute cockpit voice recording tapes for any reason other than ongoing litigation. This was conveyed to Ft. Worth Star Telegram but was ignored. Ft Worth Star Telegram obtained the  unauthorized copy of the tape from the archives of Seller's Recording Studio in Dallas, Texas. In June 1968, Braniff's Vice President Harry McKillop hired Seller's to transcribe the tape with specific instructions for only three copies to be recorded including a copy for the Department of Transportation; the Federal Aviation Administration and finally, Braniff Airways, Incorporated. Braniff has asked that Ft. Worth Star Telegram return the fourth unauthorized copy of the tape to Braniff but it has not fulfilled this reque</td><td>The unauthorized release of this tape caused great grief to the families and Braniff employees lost or involved in the accident. Further, it was believed that Braniff had released the tape to generate hype and promotion for the April 28, 2023, Braniff Flight 352 Texas Historical Marker reveal ceremony, an act that Braniff would never commit or involve itself in at any time or for any reason. In addition, it has enabled countless millions to view and hear the private and copyrighted conversations of Braniff employees that were on the transcript and tape without their authorization, which is a direct violation of work place privacy. The families of the employees that were involved with the flight have been subjected to unnecessary scrutiny especially since the pilot and Braniff were ultimately blamed for the accident.</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffff">No claim certified, no orders to amend</td><td>Richard B Cass</td><td>none</td><td>Collin L Ice</td><td>Order Granting Leave to Amend</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/23-CCB-0192">23-CCB-0192</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>Music</td><td>The respondent's use of licensed beats he does not have full or any exclusive rights to as stated in the license they have purchased.

He has not deleted or erased any of the license media I am terminating after requesting several times as of 6/1/2023.</td><td>I have asked repeatedly and I have been ignored. My work is being used without my permission after I have repeatedly told them they do not have full rights to Beat Licenses. The relief will be him taking down every song using my beats as well as the permanent deletion & cease of access to all Beat & Song files in their & any third parties involved possession. The only one that should have access to all of my music media is me because I have private & removed all of my music media from all platforms.</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffff">No claim certified, no orders to amend</td><td>Kyle M Anderson</td><td>none</td><td>Elijah A Garrett</td><td>Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/23-CCB-0191">23-CCB-0191</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>The work is the musical composition itself; The underlying melodies, harmonies, and arrangement of notes constitutes the work irrespective of instrumentation, production, arrangement, or tone quality of sound recording.</td><td>The respondent released and published publicly an unauthorized derivative work entirely based on my compositional property. The respondent did so without properly crediting me for my work on the underlying compositional elements used to create the infringing work. I asked the respondent, before the release was published, to properly name me in the release credit of the infringing work. The respondent refused to comply with my request for credit.</td><td>The infringing work used my compositional information enough that it would not be clear to the general listener who was the original author of the underlying composition. This damages my reputation to mutual parties between the respondent and I. This damage to my reputation has a direct effect on my ability to become involved in musical collaborations with other parties and music producers. It causes undue stress, emotional hardship, and protecting my copyrights takes away significant amounts of my time and attention that would otherwise be focused on my normal business. 

The relief I am seeking is a determination of infringement from the CCB. I am also seeking relief for costs because it is my belief that the infringing party has acted in bad faith during the counter claims process.</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffff">No claim certified, no orders to amend</td><td>Tyler E Barnes</td><td>none</td><td>Thomas Reeves</td><td>Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/23-CCB-0190">23-CCB-0190</a></td><td>-noninfringement</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffff">No claim certified, no orders to amend</td><td>JIANGXI JUWEN TECHNOLOGY CO.,LTD</td><td>none</td><td>Google LLC</td><td>Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/23-CCB-0189">23-CCB-0189</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>None given</td><td>Infringer uploaded and monetized content without permission.

Selby, Karen Selby, and (upon information and belief) Kalamazoo Regional Theater LLC associated for the purpose of creating, producing, and presenting for profit a musical play known as TWO PRINCES (the “Play”). Claimant shall refer to this association as “The Association.” Claimant asserts The Association constitutes a partnership under New York law, and that the respondents are jointly and severally liable for the alleged infringements.

On August 24, 2020, Respondents Ralph O. Selby and Karen Selby entered into a written agreement with Claimant, whereby Claimant would create the score, orchestrations, and new music for the Play. (Original music and lyrics were authored by Respondent Ralph O. Selby, and Claimant asserts no claim to those underlying works.) 

Claimant authored and delivered to Respondents the works set forth in Reg. No. PAU004171017 and Reg. No. SRu001541199.

The Parties subsequently had a falling out and informally agreed to terminate the August 24, 2020 agreement. In January, 2023 Claimant’s counsel delivered a proposed termination agreement to Respondents whereby, in part: Respondents would agree to cease any use of Claimant’s work; </td><td>For the alleged infringements of the works set forth in Reg. No. PAU004171017 Claimant seeks actual damages of $6,250 and an order to cease all present and future use.

The registration date for Reg. No. SRu001541199 is May 4, 2023.  Upon information and belief, the works set forth in that registration are unpublished because Respondents made them available on SoundCloud for listening but not download. Claimant reserves the right to examine this point further as the proceeding progresses. Assuming it to be correct, however,  Claimant seeks statutory damages of $3,000 for each of the three works identified in this proceeding – for a total of $9,000 and an order to cease all present and future use. Claimant has captured and attaches evidence of this infringing activity occurring after the date of registration. (Note, as well: the filenames contain Claimant’s initials. Respondents posted Claimant’s own sound recording files.)

I have not been provided with Sync Licenses (one as copyright owner and one as sound recording owner) or compensation for this usage, nor I have I received any notification or credit.

Paramount+ has claimed that they have access to my catalog of works through a company called Music Dealers Publishing. I have no record of being involved with this company and Paramount+ has not provided me with any documentation.

If I had known my work was being used in a Cheers episode, I would have kept my album up for sale. I should be appropriately credited for my work appearing in this episode, including through ISMDb account, so that I can try to actually build more sync opportunities and sell albums. 

In addition to not having a Sync License in place for usage of my work, this work is also coded as "background music" on my PRO (ASCAP) cue sheet, which I assume yields lower royalty rates.

In overlaying my photograph with a logo/text reading "UFE Ultimate Fan Experience", implying ownership of my photograph, the respondents also breached 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (a)(2), as the logo/text would meet the definition of copyright management information as set out in 17 U.S.C. § 1202 (c).

Dear Michelle,
I am a junior editor at a small publishing house in Marseille, France, called Le bruit du monde (which roughly translates as "the sounds of the world"). We are going to publish a translation into French of the memoir/autobiographical essay of a young Norwegian writer and researcher, Jan Grue. In his memoir, he deals with the issue of being a disabled man in a world that isn't meant for him to fit in, and also tells us about how he eventually came to terms with his extra-ordinary being-in-the-world, and learned to accept it. His voice is strong and we wanted to make it heard to French readers. In his book, he reminisces on how living in Amsterdam as an exchange student was both a wonderful and trying experience : the cobblestone streets, the canals, the city itself weren't meant to welcome a person in a wheelchair, and yet he came to love it and its atmosphere. He specifically remembers listening to your song again and again, "5 am in Amsterdam". He quotes 5 lines of the song in his book, and we were wondering if we could quote those lines too in our </td><td>I contacted Wendy Szymanski on April 18, 2023 and she replied on April 20, 2023.

Given the publishers conduct thus far, I am concerned that they disdain my exclusive copyrights and disregard this infringement as trifling or de minimis, and although I remain hopeful that a mutually satisfactory settlement can be achieved, I assert that this claim causes serious harm to my licensing rights and so seek full statutory relief.</td><td style = "background-color: #ffffba"><a href="/orderstoamendorcertify.html">Awaiting amendment/certification</a></td><td>Michelle Shocked</td><td>none</td><td>MacMillan Publishers</td><td>Amended Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/23-CCB-0148">23-CCB-0148</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>Other People, words and music by Michelle Shocked</td><td>Chen, while employed by Google, uploaded a bootleg recording of my performance of my encore at Yoshi's in San Francisco on March 17, 2013, to her YouTube account, https://www.youtube.com/carolcheny.

Many times, they never even cited me or my business as the source. VKP maintained this practice from at some point in 2018 through late October 2022.

Originally, in March 2021, I discovered VKP was using several of my images on their Instagram page. When an image is uploaded to Instagram, after a week of being uploaded it will display the date of the upload. The earliest dates of the images that VKP uploaded were in 2018. At first, it seemed audacious to see the number of images they were using. I didn't remember giving VKP permission. Given the two "partnerships" VKP initiated with me in 2018 and 2020 (See exhibits titled "Sponsorship that led to VKP creating Kitsap Bites in 2020" and "Partnership if I switch to LLC in 2018"), I checked my past emails sent to VKP just to make certain VKP hadn't received any prior permissions to use my images during those times. I did not find any emails of me giving permission to VK</td><td>Relief I am seeking is explained below:

1. Statutory damages and a portion of any profits VKP made off of my Keb' Mo' image. When I originally initiated this complaint, I had misunderstood the law and didn't quite understand I might be eligible for any statutory requirement. However, if the Copyright Claims Board agrees with my complaint, then I would request they consider granting me statutory damages.

2. I am requesting VKP perform an audit of their digital assets and photographs in a manner that reassures me or confirms to me that they do not have any of my images on their servers that they might inadvertently use in the future. I ask because I know they have had edited versions of my images in the past. See my exhibit of an email to the lawyer titled "Email to VKP lawyer on November 11 2022 to check servers for image" that details an image of mine that they edited.

Harm suffered is described below:

I believe that creating 100% of the music means that I should own a considerable amount of the master recording.

Comedy Spotlight Productions, Inc. (“Claimant”) is the beneficial owner of the copyright of the motion picture titled “One Night with Dice” (hereinafter “the Work”).  (See U.S. Copyright Registration No. PA0000409262; March 16, 1989)

BACKGROUND OF THE WORK:

The Work is an approximately 46-minute video featuring a recording of a live stand-up comedy performance by a Comedian.  Taped at Philadelphia’s Comedy Factory Outlet in 1986, it is a rare recording from the early stage of the Comedian’s career before he went on to achieve national name recognition.  Upon initial release by Vestron Video (then a subsidiary of Vestron, Inc.), the Work reached #2 on the Billboard Video Chart - bested only by a video release from Sir Paul McCartney himself.  This instant success was remarkable considering the Work’s VHS list price at the time ($59.99) and a complete absence of any promotional and marketing activities to generate audience interest in the Work. 

Upon expiration of the agreement between Claimant and Vestron Video in 2002, Rhino Entertainment Co. (“Rhino”), a subsidiary of Warner Bros., quickly stepped forward to acquire distribution rights to the Work.  In 2009,</td><td>Respondents' incorporation of the Work's recorded performance of an entire joke in Episode 3 of the Series does not amount to Fair Use. Hence, Respondents have infringed on Claimant's copyright.

FFS protects its videos by providing video hosting, whereby visitors to a subscriber’s website have access only to a stream of the video, rather than a copy. Hosting is configured so that video source download is unavailable.

For the span of time these illegal copies have been publicly available, FFS licensing and hosting fees for respondent would have ranged from $6,534 to $26,344, depending on the set of videos selected.

The public display and ease of free public performance enabled by respondent's illegal posting of the videos on the dominant public video service (YouTube) also harmed FFS by reducing the market for commercial licensing.

Using my work in such a manner devalues it and makes it not as desirable to other potential local clients who may wish to license it properly for it's use. I originally sent them a very reasonable $4500.00 invoice for it's use, which equates to $100.00 a month.

2) Smuin Ballet used my work to generate income for itself: admission fees, donations, and direct sponsorships from patrons.
3) for a composer, being able to tout and publicize the use of his work by a ballet company is a feather in his cap: it's validation of one's work. Smuin deprived me of the ability to publicize my involvement with this work and with their company, which is a known dance company in the world of contemporary ballet.

The normal penalty for unlicensed music use in the world of music publishing and master recordings is a 3x-10x fee penalty per infringing use. I initially proposed a 3x penalty of my normal fees for live performance/grand rights use and *no penalty multiplier* for the year-long use of the filmed performance on Smuin's website and social media sites. That total fee was $7000. Smuin rejected it saying they normally paid between $50 - $1500 for music use - which only confirmed my suspicion that Smuin is well aware of its legal obligation to license its music, and in this case, chose not to.

The Oddheader channel, as of this writing, has 770,000 subscribers and has been featured in a number of online entertainment press outlets such as Kotaku and NME for being the first to document and solve exclusive mysteries and discoveries in video games. 

The type of content in each of the original works produced by the Oddheader team involves hundreds of hours of labor spent doing numerous things such as talking to developers for the first time to get exclusive information about mysteries in games, modifying video game code to uncover never-before-seen details, and creatively composing and narrating scripted original works for publication. Every original work features new content from the subject video game that has never been published before Oddheader’s publication of the work, usually as a product of extensive research, composition, scripting, and edited material.

On September 21, 2022, Slippy Slides informed Randall and Cassandra in a private Disc</td><td>Appleby’s video “20 CREEPIEST Secrets in Kid Games,” uploaded on his T5G YouTube channel was a clear copying of the popular YouTube video series “Shocking Easter Eggs In Kids Games” from the YouTube channel Oddheader and used original work from 8 different videos produced for and by the Oddheader channel.  At no time was Appleby/T5G given any authorization, license, or permission from Oddheader for use of any Oddheader content which comprised the majority of T5G’s video without any attribution to the infringed work. Doing so caused numerous damages to Oddheader and to the Oddheader brand. 

Appleby’s unauthorized use of the materials produced by the Oddheader channel was designed to intentionally misled his audience into thinking the original material was his own and to confuse the marketplace. It was an attempt to move traffic away from the Oddheader channel and to his own channel, T5G, using unauthorized, original, creative material originally produced by and for the Oddheader channel. 

Appleby’s unauthorized use passes off hundreds of hours of labor and creative research from the Oddheader channel as his own for commercial monetary gains.

Thank you so much for the opportunity to present this matter before the CCB. Please find below a  brief background of the issue:

In March of 2015, I hired Mark Saxenmeyer of The Reporters Inc. a Minneapolis-based media production agency to assist with fundraising and perform certain production work for completion of my documentary film series titled: The Innocent Convicts. A fundraising contract and Project Assistance Area Agreement(see attached please) were drafted by The Reporters Inc. Executive Director, Mark Saxenmeyer which expressly provides ownership of all videos created for The Innocent Convicts project belong to me and my studio-Mankind Pictures. I paid the sum of $250 out of $500 which was due as project initiation fee as stated in that agreement. Although I initially titled the Project Tim Cole, The Innocent Man, I renamed it The Innocent Convicts in 2015 due to the need to include more stories to the Film project.

I started with filming the  story of Tim Cole in Texas and three years later, we had completed production of six stories that happened in five different cities with a timeline of completion set for 2016/17. The project was not completed a</td><td>I have made multiple request for the raw and completed copies of the videos in the possession of Mark Saxenmeyer and The Reporters Inc., and they have refused to provide the videos to me. I also requested a detailed breakdown of funds raised as well as Expenditure report and all materials related to the film. Mark Saxenmeyer has seized the raw and final work product of The Innocent Convicts film unlawfully and has refused to provide accounting for the money raise for this project which is a breach of our agreement. 

Mark Saxenmeyer has continued to distribute The Innocent Convicts film online and at educational institutions without my permission, and has continued to profit from my work without my consent. See attached letters on behalf of the Reporters Inc. to me and vice versa please. Also attached are the Agenda and Minutes of the Reporters Inc. Board Meeting in 2016, and Email indicating title name change..

Only towards the third quarter of last year we heard from Mark's lawyer after l contacted another attorney based in Minneapolis to reach out to him. On the Reporters Inc. website, they removed my film about Tim Cole and renamed my other 5 films "Guilty Until Proven Inn</td><td style = "background-color: #ffdfba"><a href="/closedcases.html">Closed</a></td><td>Osagie Okoruwa</td><td>none</td><td>Mark Saxenmeyer</td><td>Order Dismissing Claim</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/22-CCB-0176">22-CCB-0176</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>Website text and headings</td><td>KidsVelo Bikes directly copied large paragraphs of our website text without our consent.</td><td>KidsVelo bikes plagiarized our unique content, this is bad for google rankings and therefore bad for our online sales.

To make matters worse, the quality of the food is in serious question, as consumers have reported feeling discomfort after eating at the Infringing Restaurant. See Exhibit 25.
 
The foregoing harm is irreparable and is exacerbated by the fact that in the Infringing Restaurants and in associated marketing materials, JMC has intentionally displayed and reproduced the copyrighted images, characters, costumes, and character names, and derivative works thereof, from the Works.  
 
JMC created, displayed, and reproduced the Infringing Materials willfully, and in knowing disregard of Paramount Pictures’ copyrights, of which JMC was on notice long before it began its infringing conduct.
 
On information and belief, all of JMC’s conduct described herein has been and continues to be willful, wanton, and in bad faith, and none has been with the authorization or consent of Paramount Pictures.

On December 18, 2019, I discovered that my photograph of one of my original acrylic paintings was being used as the primary advertising photo to sell “BYOB” acrylic pour painting classes at a New York-based company called “The Paint Place” through the website CourseHorse.com.

They posted this photo in affiliation with multiple classes being held at least two different “The Paint Place” art studio locations in the New York City area throughout 2019 and 2020.

According to posts of class listings on CourseHorse.com for “BYOB Panting: Paint Pouring” that had my photograph posted on them, these classes were being sold at a price of $60 per person, had an “average of twenty students” per class, and were often listed as being “sold out”.

This photograph was of artwork that I created as part of an acrylic pour painting tutorial that I wrote and published exclusively on the arts & crafts website FeltMagnet.com on September 4th, 2018.

The many “BYOB Painting: Paint Pouring” art classes at two New York City art studios being sold on CourseHorse.com and/or The Paint Place for $60 per person with twenty student classes over the course of multiple years, using my photograph as the primary advertising image on their websites, generated revenue for one or both of these companies that I received no compensation for.

Internet traffic to my painting tutorial article that includes this photograph has gone down in the last several years as search engines view a photo appearing on multiple websites as duplicate content and de-prioritize the site in search results, which reduces my earnings from this article.

Etsy then allowed this person to relist my content and retaliatory remove my shops content, and allowed the user to list  myself my name and my address for sale as an item in her shop for $10 and as far as I know you cannot sell human beings. 

Etsy also allowed this person to defame my character and write 1 star reviews of my content claiming that it was poor or not my own.

On or around March 20, 2022, I noticed that he was using my copyrighted Channel Icon #6 as his channel icon without my authorization, and so on March 20, 2022, I issued a DMCA takedown to Twitch asking for it to be taken down. However, Twitch did not take the infringement down. They replied to my DMCA Takedown Notice and asked that I provide proof that I actually own the copyright to this icon.

This is not a valid request. 17 USC § 512(c)(3)(A)(i)-(vi) sets forth six things that a DMCA Takedown Notice must include. I included all six of these things and can easily provide proof thereof once this case gets underway. At no point does the DMCA require me to provide proof of copyright ownership when I issue a DMCA Takedown Notice. The law does not entitle the ISP to request additional details, other than those set forth in § 512(c)(3)(A)(i)-(vi), to verify an otherwise statutorily-compliant takedown notice.

"I am authorised to use the materials on this addresses as the materials published are available for public use and distribution in Chinese language. We translated these copies to English for our audience"

Respondent 2:
"I am not the owner, but I am authorized to use the content"

This item wasn't lifted from the quoted website, rather it's a material that's accessible in the public domain (although must use a translator to access it fully). We belong to a group where we have access to these materials to use, share, read, etc."

I sent a resume in response. (I worked at E! Entertainment Television on the non-fiction series “Celebrity Profile” and “True Hollywood Story,” and had written several award show red carpet scripts for TV Guide Network.) 

I heard back quickly from the producer, Tara Pirnia. She needed a short turnaround on a script for a show about the fashion evolution of Kate Middleton. When I quoted a price of $1000, she talked me into lowering it by half to $500, saying that it was the pilot for a series and she would pay me more for the next script. I agreed. 

She sent me a rough outline that included bullet points for each segment, divided up into nine blocks plus a cold open. After researching and writing the script, I submitted my first draft with my original title “Kate Middleton: Duchess of Style.” Tara praised my work in subsequent emails. She seemed pleased with my writing. I stayed in touch with Tara during the revision process, and she gave me additional note</td><td>I am entitled to damages because this was no accident. Tara Pirnia has practiced this kind of fraud and deception before. In documentation which I will attach I will demonstrate that she has a history of legal actions being brought against her to collect on rents, wages, and other monies that went unpaid due to her repeated deliberate actions meant to defraud others. Copies of these complaints are attached, as well as a list of all small claims cases brought against her.

As recently as 2021, a complaint was filed by Amanda Raymond, the writer and director of a feature film Tara Pirnia produced. The cause of action was breach of contract. In the complaint the Amanda Raymond states that Tara Pirnia had no intention of paying the deferred compensation, contingent compensation or travel expenses as outlined in her contract. A copy of the complaint is attached. 

In my case, Tara Pirnia took one script I wrote and used it for two shows. She then resold these shows around the world in streaming and international distribution deals, including DVDs.

This caused an immeasurable amount of damage to our organization and the author, damaging author credibility, damaging company reputation in the field as a new publishing agency, establishing a significant loss in marking/public credibility and perception, resulting in poor reviews which further damaged sales, and causing extreme mental duress to our author and publication team.</td><td style = "background-color: #ffdfba"><a href="/closedcases.html">Closed</a></td><td>Tactical Training Academy LLC, DBA Pacific Books</td><td>none</td><td>Ingram Content Group, Lightning Source LLC</td><td>Order Dismissing Without Prejudice</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://dockets.ccb.gov/case/detail/22-CCB-0012">22-CCB-0012</a></td><td>infringement</td><td>Instructions and paper prompts for an essay that students were required to write in a university course that I teach.</td><td>EssayZoo markets itself to college students and describes itself as "the Most Reliable Place to Buy Pre Written Essays" (essayzoo.org, accessed 6/16/22).

The first time I became aware of one on Instagram, I sent a DMCA notice to Paris' company, at management@parishiltonentertainment.com on 9/17/2020 for the Sept. 2020 infringement, as that was the one I became aware of first, requesting removal of the infringing work from Paris' Instagram account.

My infringements of this IP have increased greatly in the last 3 years but especially in the last 2. I believe these infringements played a part in that by giving Paris' viewers the impression that my IP is a freely available work to use should they find it being distributed (illegally) online.
I believe it may also be causing brand confusion between myself and a competing fairy wing maker, HelloFaerie, who engaged in slandering me a few years ago when she was trying to compete in the market. HelloFaerie has been providing Paris with her fairy wings for the last 2 or 3 years. Her business was built upon the foundation my work created.
Since these infringements, I have been incorrectly credited or tagged as the wing maker in posts showing HelloFaerie's work quite a few times.
This has been adding insult to injury.
